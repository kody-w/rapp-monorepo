## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A slow machine can start the desktop app** — the app waits for the gateway
  it spawned to report ready and then kills it. That budget only ever runs out
  when the gateway is alive and merely slow (a genuine startup failure is
  reported immediately by its exit), which is a cold first run, an antivirus
  scan or a loaded machine. `OPENRAPPTER_GATEWAY_READY_TIMEOUT_MS` now sets it;
  the 30-second default is unchanged. A malformed value is ignored rather than
  fatal, and the accepted maximum is ten minutes.

- **One chat, both brains** — the brainstem runs as its own process speaking
  `POST /chat` while the OpenRappter runtime answers `chat.send`, so holding a
  conversation across both used to mean two chat windows. `chat.send` now takes
  an optional `target` (`openrappter` by default, or `brainstem`), and the web
  dashboard and the macOS Bar each carry a selector that remembers the choice.
  This works because both runtimes already return the same
  `rapp-runtime-parity/1.0` §2.4 envelope, so a reply from either renders
  identically. An unrecognised target is refused rather than defaulted: the two
  brains know different things and their replies are the same shape, so a typo
  that quietly answered from the wrong one would be indistinguishable.
  `OPENRAPPTER_BRAINSTEM_URL` overrides the address; otherwise both the
  documented port and the RAPP drop-in slot are probed.

- **A `Brainstem` agent in both runtimes** — the selector lets a person switch
  brains, which still leaves them relaying answers by hand. The agent gives the
  assistant the same reach, dispatched like any other tool through the ordinary
  chat endpoint, so "ask the brainstem what it knows about this and compare it
  to your own view" works in one turn. Declares exactly the `network`
  capability its syntax tree can reach, per the RAPP agent contract.

### Fixed

- **A non-numeric Pokemon setting crashed the agent instead of being refused** —
  `port`, `max_clips`, `max_states`, `max_storage_gb`, `min_free_gb` and
  `startup_timeout` are chosen by a model, so they arrive as whatever it
  produced, and each was passed straight to `int()` or `float()`. `int("abc")`
  raises `ValueError`, nothing above it caught `ValueError`, and one odd
  argument took the agent down rather than coming back as an error.
  `startup_timeout` was worse than the rest: it was read *after* the supervisor
  had been spawned, so a bad value left a live process behind with nothing
  tracking it. All six are now coerced before anything is started, and a bad
  one names the setting that was wrong.
- **Two conformance checks could not fail** — R8 asserts the RAPP substrate is
  attributed, which its own docstring calls the licence condition, but it
  tested for `rapp` as a plain substring, and open**rapp**ter contains it; the
  check passed on a README with every mention of the substrate deleted (`mit`
  was the same shape, satisfied by "commit"). R6 asserts the brainstem keeps
  wire parity, but tested for the bare word `response`, which survives in
  `send_response`; renaming every `"response":` key in the `/chat` envelope —
  the exact breakage R6 exists to prevent — left it reporting parity. Both now
  match the token rather than the substring.
- **Three agents held capabilities they cannot reach** — `DocScannerAgent`,
  `NotesIntakeAgent` and `WebAgent` declared `process-exec` while importing no
  `child_process` at all; what they contain is regular-expression `.exec()`
  calls. The two scanners additionally declared `filesystem-write` while
  importing only `readdir`, `stat` and `readFile`. Read-only scanners therefore
  held the two most dangerous capabilities in the vocabulary, so a policy
  denying either would have refused agents that only match text. `conformance.py`
  enforces this as R5, but R5 reads Python agents only; TypeScript now has an
  equivalent check, and R4, R5 and R7 say which runtime they cover.
- **The conformance gate accepted a manifest that wasn't one** — R2 passed any
  non-Python agent whose file merely *contained* the substrings `__manifest__`
  and `rapp-agent/1.0`, and R3 checked required fields for Python agents only.
  Both were satisfied by `ComputerUseAgent.ts` at a point when it exported no
  manifest at all, so the gate reported a clean run over a broken contract.
  Both checks now read the declaration itself, which also surfaced
  `morning_brief_agent.js` carrying a name that is not `@scope/slug`; it is now
  `@openrappter/morning-brief`.
- **`read_screen` never worked, and Computer Use declared no capabilities** — a
  generated manifest block had been inserted at a byte offset that fell inside
  the Python source string `ComputerUseAgent` uses for OCR. The agent therefore
  exported no `__manifest__` at all, leaving its `filesystem-write` and
  `process-exec` declarations invisible to anything that reads manifests, and
  the OCR script was a syntax error so screen reading could only ever fail. The
  capability check did not notice because it matches source text rather than
  the runtime export; it now verifies both, and that the two agree.
- **A cron job created without an agent fired on time and then found no agent**
  — `addJob` defaulted the agent to `main` while the daemon executor resolved
  only `Assistant` and the runtime's own name, so every job created without an
  explicit agent was accepted, persisted, scheduled and fired exactly on time
  before failing with `Agent not found: main`. Both sides now share one
  constant and one resolver.

- **The channels screen went stale after the first load** — it listened for
  `channel.status` and nothing ever emitted it, so connecting or disconnecting
  a channel left the previous state on screen until reload. Connecting and
  disconnecting now notify subscribers with the changed channel, in the same
  shape `channels.list` returns.

- **`config validate` called a security policy valid while nothing enforced it**
  — a config setting `approvalPolicy: deny` was told `Configuration is valid.`,
  and the ignored-key report stayed silent too because the section really is in
  the schema. Validation now names sections that are valid but enforced by
  nothing, and says what does the enforcing instead.

- **The agent that places phone calls declared a capability that does not exist**
  — `PhoneAgent` declared `network-access`, which is not in the vocabulary; the
  word is `network`, used by every other networked agent. Any filter selecting
  on `network` skipped the one agent that dials real people. Declared
  capabilities are now checked against the list `conformance.py` defines.

- **The published agent counts described a developer's laptop, not the product**
  — `architecture.html`, the README and two other pages advertised 37 TypeScript
  agents. That number came from running `--list-agents` on a machine that also
  loads the operator's own agents from `~/.openrappter/agents`, so it counted
  three that no one else has. A fresh install ships **34 TypeScript and 20
  Python agents**; the pages now say so, and a guard per runtime re-derives the
  figure with `HOME` isolated so the published number cannot drift back to
  whatever the author happens to have installed.

- **Stop did not stop the brainstem** — `chat.abort` marked the run aborted and
  the interface went quiet, while the request carried on, produced a full reply,
  and had it discarded. Stop looked like it worked from every angle a person can
  see, and a hosted model kept generating billed output nobody would read. A run
  now carries an `AbortController` whose signal reaches the request itself.

- **GoogleVoiceAgent never loaded in the Python runtime** — every
  `--list-agents` printed `Failed to load … No module named 'agents'` and listed
  18 agents where TypeScript listed 19. The agent was not at fault: it is
  written to the portability contract, which permits `agents.basic_agent` and
  little else so the same file runs in the grail brainstem. The loader built
  that synthetic namespace and skipped the one module a portable agent is
  allowed to import.

- **PythonAgent failed to load on every single run** — built-in discovery calls
  `new` on every exported `BasicAgent` subclass, and `PythonAgent` is a wrapper
  built per descriptor that needs constructor arguments. It threw, was recorded
  as a broken agent file, and printed a warning above every `--list-agents`.

- **The Bones window told a fresh install it had no agents** — the agents
  section reads only the user's own directory, and the built-ins live inside the
  installed package. On a fresh machine it said "No agents installed yet" while
  37 agents were working; measured here, it counted 5 against a runtime that
  reported 37.

- **A slow PowerShell start aborted Windows ACL hardening** —
  `hardenPrivatePath` spawns a fresh `powershell.exe` for every private path and
  capped it at 15 seconds, which a cold start on a loaded machine can exceed.
  Every caller that asks for a private path takes the throw, so Show-and-Tell
  simply failed to start. Raised to 60s and retried once, but only for a process
  that never got off the ground — a refused or unverifiable ACL still fails
  closed on the first attempt.

- **`config validate` called a mostly-inert config file valid** — Zod strips
  unknown keys rather than rejecting them, so a file could parse cleanly while
  almost nothing in it was read. Validation still passes, since these are not
  errors, but it now lists the keys that will be ignored. This is why the
  published config documentation drifted so far: the tool whose job is to check
  the file agreed with it.

- **A published install had none of the 52 bundled skills** — `files` in
  `package.json` never listed `skills/`, so every tarball carried
  `dist/skills/bundled.js` and none of the `SKILL.md` files it reads. The
  loader swallows a missing directory and returns an empty list, so an install
  that shipped nothing looked exactly like one that legitimately had no
  skills. The packaging test now asserts against what npm would really
  publish, and asserts the count exactly, because shipping a subset is the
  same silent failure in a smaller form.
- **`cron.delete` reported success while the job kept running** — the alias
  filtered only the file-backed store, so the live scheduler kept the job and
  it fired on schedule after the user had been told it was gone. Deleting an
  id that never existed also reported success. Both now go through one bound
  removal that clears the scheduler and the store, and an unknown id is
  refused.
- **`cron.get` denied a job the gateway had just created** — it read only the
  file fallback, never the live scheduler, so a job created in this process
  was invisible until something persisted it. `cron.update` was not registered
  at all, though the macOS Bar calls it. `list` and `get` now share one
  mapping, so two readers of the same job cannot describe it differently.
- **A Bar-created cron job ran with an empty prompt** — the Bar sent
  `command` and the scheduler read `message`, so the job was created, reported
  `scheduled: true`, got a `nextRun`, and fired on time carrying nothing.
  `message` is canonical; `command` is accepted as an alias and normalised
  away. An empty prompt is now refused rather than scheduled.
- **Storage lied about three things** — a `transaction()` callback that
  awaited kept writing after the rollback was reported, because better-sqlite3
  rejects async transaction functions; migrations wrote their DDL and their
  version marker separately, so a partial failure bricked every later start
  with `duplicate column name`; and `INSERT OR REPLACE` on sessions and devices
  is a delete-then-insert, which fired `ON DELETE SET NULL` and destroyed the
  approval records pointing at them. Renaming a cron job cascaded away its run
  logs the same way.
- **The Bar's approval screen never worked** — `exec.pending` and
  `exec.respond` were not registered, so the approve and deny buttons could not
  function. They are now wired to the real `ExecSafety` engine that `ShellAgent`
  blocks on: a deny genuinely denies, an approval is single-use, and unknown,
  expired or already-resolved ids are refused instead of accepted. The gateway
  also now emits the `approval` event the Bar has always listened for, so the
  list no longer waits for the screen to be reopened.
- **The Bar's Logs pane and session reset called nothing** — `logs.get` and
  `sessions.reset` were unregistered. `logs.get` now reads the daemon's real
  launchd log files, bounded and redacted through the shared secret redactor;
  `sessions.reset` clears the real session store and aborts the run in flight,
  because otherwise the reply repopulated the session after reporting success.
- **The dashboard's agent file browser called nothing** — `agents.files.list`,
  `agents.files.read` and `agents.files.write` were unregistered, and
  `cron.runs` duplicated `cron.logs`. The file methods are treated as the
  remote code-execution surface they are: the resolved real path must sit
  inside the agent directory, reserved directories are refused as an agent id
  and as any path segment, symlinks are never written through, and `write` may
  only replace an existing file so it cannot plant a new agent.
- **The zen list ignored the events announcing its own sessions** — the
  gateway broadcasts `zen.session.start` and `zen.session.end`; nothing
  listened, so the list was only as fresh as the moment the screen opened.

- **Zen viewer works** — `<openrappter-zen>` is live UI, but `zen.sessions`,
  `zen.subscribe` and `zen.unsubscribe` were never registered on the gateway,
  so the page answered `-32601 Method not found` on load and rendered an empty
  screen forever. They are now registered against live streaming state owned by
  the running server. `src/gateway/methods/zen-methods.ts` was deliberately not
  reused: it reads `peer-stream.ts`'s process-local `globalPeerStream`, whose
  only writer (`openrappter bar --tui`) runs in a different process from the
  daemon, so it could only ever have reported an empty list. Producers now feed
  the daemon over the wire (`zen.publish`/`zen.end`, WebSocket only), the Bar's
  pong screen publishes through it, frames reach only the connections that
  subscribed, and a dropped connection releases its viewer slots and ends the
  sessions it was producing. The client-RPC coverage guard now also walks
  `ui/src/components`, not just `ui/src/services`: `zen.ts` is a component, so
  the guard never saw the three broken calls — their debt entries had been
  listed by hand rather than found.
- **The Bar's usage screen shows real numbers** — `UsageViewModel` calls
  `usage.stats` and `usage.history`, and the live `GatewayServer` registered
  neither, so both answered `Method not found` and the screen only ever
  rendered an error. Both are now registered against the Flight Recorder's
  `provider.attempt.completed` events, which is where provider-reported token
  counts are actually recorded. `gateway/methods/usage-methods.ts` was
  deliberately *not* wired: it declares different names (`usage.status`,
  `usage.cost`) against a `usageTracker` nothing in this repository
  constructs, and answers a hardcoded zero without one. Cost is reported as
  `costAvailable: false` rather than `$0.0000` — no price table exists in this
  runtime. `RpcClient.getUsageHistory()` also decoded timestamps with a bare
  `JSONDecoder`, whose `.deferredToDate` strategy threw on the gateway's
  ISO-8601 strings; the throw was swallowed by `try?`, so a populated response
  was silently rendered as an empty list.
- **The Bar's Skills and Nodes panes call methods that exist** — `skills.list`,
  `skills.install` and `connections.disconnect` were answered with
  `Method not found` by the live gateway; they are now registered in
  `registerBuiltInMethods` against the real bundled `skills/` directory, the
  real `SkillsRegistry`, and the gateway's own live connection map.
  `skills.install` requires the gateway credential, because it fetches a
  third-party manifest off the network and writes it where the agent will load
  it.
- **`skills.list` cannot report a packaging fault as an empty list** — a
  missing bundled `skills/` directory now raises instead of answering `[]`,
  which was indistinguishable from a machine that legitimately has no skills.
- **`skills.list` and `connections.list` answer in the shape the Bar decodes** —
  both payloads omitted fields the macOS `Skill`/`Node` decoders require, so
  the Bar showed "No skills installed" over 52 shipped skills and an empty
  Nodes pane over live connections. `RpcClient` no longer turns a decode
  failure into an empty array either.
- **`connections.disconnect` does not claim to have closed a connection that
  was not there** — an unknown connection id is an error.
- **`connections.pair` stays unregistered, deliberately** — nothing in the
  gateway can record a remote peer, and `connections.list` reports inbound
  sockets, so a successful pairing would be followed by a list that still
  showed nothing. The Bar gets a refusal it can display instead.
- **Python storage adapter is genuinely thread-safe** — `SqliteStorageAdapter`
  held an `RLock` (implying multi-threaded use) but opened its connection with
  sqlite3's default `check_same_thread=True`, so any call from a worker thread
  — a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, the gateway's executor, a cron worker — raised
  `sqlite3.ProgrammingError`. The connection is now opened with
  `check_same_thread=False` and every use of it, including cursor results and
  `rowcount`, is funnelled through a single lock-holding gate.
- **Browser private network access** — reaching a private or loopback address
  from the browser agent now requires an explicit operator opt-in
  (`allowPrivateNetwork`, off by default) rather than being reachable by
  default.
- **Full IPv6 link-local range blocked** — the SSRF guard covered only part of
  `fe80::/10`; the whole range is now rejected.
- **Allowlisted domains match on DNS-label boundaries** — `evil-example.com`
  no longer satisfies an allowlist entry of `example.com`.
- **Chunked downloads are bounded while they stream** — a declared length is
  not a promise, so the cap is enforced as bytes arrive rather than checked up
  front.
- **Cron job ids** — the scheduler sends the job id the gateway actually
  reads, and cron logs can no longer outlive or precede the job they belong
  to.
- **Shell exit codes** — Python returned `status=success` for every completed
  subprocess even on a nonzero exit, so `false` reported `return_code=1` while
  the shared classifier recorded success. Python now derives status from the
  return code; TypeScript already did.
- **Composite error status** — `AgentGraph` and `BroadcastManager` (both
  runtimes) only noticed a sub-agent failure when the call *threw*, so an agent
  that correctly reported `{"status": "error"}` was recorded as a success and
  the composite reported success overall. Both layers now classify through the
  shared `agentResultIsError` / `agent_result_is_error` helper, which also
  accepts an already-parsed envelope. A failed graph node now skips its
  dependents (or halts the graph under `stopOnError`); a broadcast keeps the
  full error envelope per branch but no longer counts it as a success, falls
  through to the next agent in `fallback` mode (forwarding the failed agent's
  `data_slush`), and never lets an error envelope win a `race`. Cross-runtime
  agreement is pinned by `contracts/agent-result-status-vectors.json`.
- **The rest of the composition layers had the same blind spot** — `AgentChain`,
  `PipelineAgent`, and `SubAgentManager` (both runtimes) also equated failure
  with a throw. A chain with `stopOnError` ran every remaining step past a step
  that returned `{"status": "error"}` and reported `partial` instead of `error`;
  `PipelineAgent` hard-coded every completed step to `status: 'success'`, so
  `onError` never fired at all and the pipeline reported `completed`; and
  `SubAgentManager` recorded a failed call as a success in its call history.
  All three now classify through the same shared helper. The failed payload is
  never discarded: the chain keeps the envelope as `finalResult`, the pipeline
  keeps each branch's result, and a sub-agent's error envelope is still returned
  to its caller (only the bookkeeping changes). The chain rollup also folds
  `{"status": "ERROR"}`, which its old case-sensitive comparison called success.
  A new `agentResultErrorMessage` / `agent_result_error_message` reports a failed
  step's reason identically whether the agent threw or returned an envelope, and
  is pinned by the same contract file.
- **The pipeline agent stays loadable without the kernel** — `pipeline_agent.py`
  is a single-file agent, so RAPP conformance R7 requires it to load with no
  kernel import at all. Its use of the shared classifier is a guarded import
  (the pattern `shell_agent.py` already uses) with a local fallback that mirrors
  the shared implementation verbatim; the two are pinned against each other over
  every contract vector by a test that loads the agent with no `openrappter`
  package present.
- **`config` and `doctor` were never registered** — both were implemented and
  exported, but their words fell through to chat and global help while shipped
  health guidance told you to run them. Registering them exposed dormant bugs:
  `get`/`set` no longer echo credential values, validation strictly parses both
  config files against the real schema, and `doctor` returns nonzero for failed
  checks in JSON mode too.
- **`voice-call` skill** prescribed `call start`, `call end` and
  `call conference`, none of which exist, and required a legacy plugin switch
  no OpenRappter code reads. It now documents the flow that ships.

### Changed

- The Electron desktop is the authority for OpenRappter Bar authentication,
  and desktop smoke tests were hardened for concurrent and Windows runs.

### Security

- **The installer's checksum check could pass having verified nothing** — the
  one-line install downloads a `gum` release tarball and verifies it against
  the project's published `checksums.txt` using `sha256sum --ignore-missing`.
  That flag is necessary, since the file lists every platform and only one
  asset is downloaded, but GNU `sha256sum` exits 0 when it is left with nothing
  to verify at all. An asset simply absent from the list therefore read as a
  pass, so anyone able to serve the release could omit a line rather than forge
  a hash. macOS `shasum` exits 1 in the same case, so whether the installer was
  safe depended on which tool was installed — and `sha256sum` is tried first.
  The downloaded file must now be named in the checksums before any verdict is
  believed.
- **Agents no longer build shell command lines by interpolation** — every
  remaining site in `ComputerUseAgent`, `DailyTipAgent`, `DemoRecorderAgent`,
  `HackerNewsAgent`, `OuroborosAgent` and `UpdateAgent` now passes an argument
  vector. None was reachable with attacker-controlled input, so this is
  hardening rather than a fix, but it removes the shape that produced three
  real injections. Notification text is escaped for AppleScript, which is what
  it was always for, and the demo listing uses the filesystem instead of `ls`.
- **Learning a new agent could run arbitrary commands** — `learn_new_agent`
  asks a model to write agent code, scans that code for imports, and installs
  them, so an import specifier is model-authored untrusted input. It was
  interpolated into a shell command line, and the import pattern permits both
  spaces and semicolons, so generated code containing
  `import x from 'lodash; touch pwned'` executed the second command. Installs
  now use an argument vector, and package names are checked against npm's own
  grammar before use.
- **Turning authentication on no longer severs the neighborhood** — a rappter
  contacting a peer sent no credential at all, while `/twin` and `/chat` both
  authenticate before parsing. Those were compatible only because
  authentication was off by default; a peer with a token refused every sender,
  including one whose environment held the credential. Both wires now present
  `Authorization: Bearer` when `OPENRAPPTER_TOKEN` is set, and send no
  authorization header at all when there is none rather than a malformed one.

- **The published container ran everything as root** — the root `Dockerfile`
  declared no `USER`, and `docker-compose.yml` mounted the config volume at
  `/root/.openrappter` to match. Anything that gets code execution inside that
  container — and this process runs a shell agent by design — was root in it,
  with the credential directory mounted in. Now runs as the unprivileged `node`
  account, with `HOME` and the compose mount moved to match.

- **`openrappter login` printed both tokens** — it echoed the first 20
  characters of the access token, and of the refresh token when one was
  issued. A prefix is still credential material: it lands in terminal
  scrollback and in CI logs, and it narrows a brute force. The command now
  names the provider and says nothing derived from the secret. It remains
  unregistered — it also persists nothing while claiming it saved — so this
  was latent rather than live, which is exactly why it needed a test before
  somebody registers it.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Show-and-Tell mode** in TypeScript and Python — record a real workflow,
  reconstruct its intent and ordered semantic steps, review it, and build a
  portable `SKILL.md`, a disabled automation, or both.
- **Cross-runtime recording store** — a private SQLite WAL database gives
  TypeScript and Python the same session, event, analysis, consent, and artifact
  contract with transactionally allocated event order.
- **Detached context collectors** — macOS, Windows, and Linux adapters capture
  active app/window context after the CLI exits. Browser URLs lose query and
  fragment data, and screenshots are explicit-only.
- **Local consent boundaries** — recording, optional Copilot analysis,
  approval, and deletion each require a short-lived, one-use token issued by an
  interactive local terminal.
- **Safe workflow packaging** — generated skills include manifests understood
  by both runtimes; automations are disabled by default; replay is a dry run
  rather than coordinate playback.
- **Electron desktop shell** — packages the current OpenRappter UI and runtime
  behind a sandboxed, context-isolated renderer, launches or reuses the local
  gateway, and adds a visual Skill Recorder-style Show-and-Tell workspace.
- **Native desktop consent** — recording, scoped active-window capture,
  workflow approval, and deletion use Electron main-process confirmation
  dialogs; consent tokens and filesystem paths never reach the renderer.
- **Chat-driven desktop control** — the `DesktopControl` agent snapshots the
  composed shadow-DOM UI and drives navigation, clicks, fields, selection,
  scrolling, and waits through semantic refs while the user watches.
- **Approved agent injection** — `.py` and `*_agent.ts` sources can be supplied
  through chat, capability-scanned, hash-disclosed, natively approved, compiled
  when needed, verified by loading, and hot-added to the live assistant.
- **On-device narration** — Whisper Small q8 downloads once (~252 MB), records
  optional microphone narration, transcribes locally, and adds the transcript
  to the active Show-and-Tell timeline.
- **On-device voice preview** — pinned Microsoft VibeVoice Realtime 0.5B source
  and model (~2.04 GB weights) self-bootstrap into a private Python 3.11
  environment and loopback-only server; VibeVoice generated WAV audio
  successfully on Apple MPS.
- **Unified tray and Bar** — Electron provides quick chat/recording/voice tray
  actions and publishes a private authenticated endpoint that the Swift
  OpenRappter Bar prefers over launching a competing gateway.

### Security

- Typed ComputerUse text is represented only by length, never content.
- Credential- and sign-in-looking windows refuse screenshot capture.
- Raw frames and frame paths are never sent to Copilot; only the separately
  approved privacy-safe textual event summary can leave the machine.
- Session roots, databases, frames, skills, manifests, and automation bundles
  use owner-only permissions and reject symlinked destinations.
- Electron carries an isolated packed runtime and Electron-ABI SQLite binding;
  the system Node binding is never rebuilt or shared.
- The desktop gateway uses a random per-process bearer token and a dedicated
  loopback port. The endpoint file is private, bounded, and removed only by its
  owning process.
- VibeVoice is an opt-in preview with explicit responsible-use disclosure; the
  server is loopback-only, access logs are disabled, text is bounded, and
  source/model/tokenizer revisions are pinned.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Provider-neutral Flight Recorder** in TypeScript and Python — a local
  SQLite WAL ledger records correlated trace, context, provider, tool, and
  agent lifecycle events under `openrappter-event/1.0`.
- **Privacy-safe defaults** — raw prompts, responses, tool arguments, and file
  contents are omitted unless explicitly enabled. Opt-in IO is recursively
  scrubbed for secret keys, secret-shaped values, sensitive paths, circular
  values, unsafe numbers, and bounded by a post-redaction byte cap.
- **Integrity-checked replay bundles** — versioned
  `openrappter-flight-export/1.0` export/import with SHA-256 event hashes,
  atomic tamper rejection, durable sequence continuity, and a committed
  TypeScript/Python golden vector.
- **Flight Recorder CLI** — `flight status`, `events`, `export`, `import`, and
  confirmation-gated `clear`.
- **Release-enforced cross-runtime gate** — behavior, mutation, privacy,
  causality, retention, package, TypeScript, and Python validation now block
  release artifact publication.

### Changed

- Provider responses may report the concrete model that actually answered;
  `auto` remains a routing policy in metadata instead of being persisted as a
  false model identity.
- Retention prunes whole completed traces and preserves active traces rather
  than leaving replay fragments without their start/context events. Nested and
  resumed activity is evaluated by lifecycle depth in trace sequence order.
- Replay exports read one uncapped SQLite snapshot, while interactive queries
  retain their 10,000-event safety cap.
- Trace sequence allocation reloads after cross-process SQLite conflicts, and
  long-trace recovery uses one descending lookup rather than capped paging.
  Lifecycle durations use monotonic clocks rather than wall time.
- Absolute workspace paths are persisted as stable SHA-256 scope identifiers,
  not raw filesystem paths.
- Session identifiers are persisted as stable SHA-256 scope identifiers so
  channel keys cannot leak phone numbers, email addresses, or chat GUIDs.
  A private per-installation HMAC key prevents offline dictionary reversal.

### Security

- Persisted error metadata contains only safe class/code/status, message hash,
  and message length. Raw provider response bodies remain opt-in payload data.
- Flight databases, live WAL/SHM sidecars, and atomically replaced export
  bundles use private filesystem modes. Custom database paths do not chmod
  caller-owned parent directories.
- Session/channel identifiers are normalized at the recorder boundary, and
  Python query aliases reject unknown filters instead of silently exporting an
  over-broad history.
- Secret-shaped and excluded-path property names are replaced with
  collision-safe markers before hashing or persistence; contents under
  excluded filenames such as `.pem`, `.p12`, and service-account files are
  removed.
- Direct provider calls in telephony, Surgeon, LearnNew, Ouroboros, and
  iMessage readiness checks now emit the same provider lifecycle evidence as
  Assistant turns.
- The Copilot CLI MCP child initializes its own recorder, streaming preserves
  provider-reported model identity, and unknown fallback models remain
  explicitly unattributed.
- Copilot CLI child tools inherit the originating trace/parent scope and record
  a tool-to-agent causal subtree rather than a disconnected child trace.
- Standalone records evict sequence caches, and explicit recorder installation
  remains synchronized with environment bootstrap.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **One device, many rappters** — an *alpha* holds the default port and the
  device's channels, and any number of *hatched twins* run beside it, each with
  its own identity, port, and lock. `openrappter hatch <name>`,
  `openrappter twins`, and `--instance <id>` address them.
- **Twin-to-twin chat** — a rappter can speak to a peer, not only be spoken to.
  `POST /twin` carries the `rapp-twin-chat/1.0` envelope, and a peer that
  speaks `/chat` but not `/twin` is still reachable.
- **Neighbourhood and roster** — a running rappter can reach a neighbour, tells
  its neighbours which twin it is, and is judged by the same name the roster
  calls it.
- **Copilot Surgeon primary interface** — replaces the static dashboard landing
  page with an adaptive operating room where OpenRappter is the patient and
  GitHub Copilot shapes each next interaction from live, sanitized patient
  anatomy. Existing operational pages remain available as secondary anatomy.
- **Consent-bound procedures** — Copilot proposals are persisted with an
  immutable SHA-256 digest, require explicit owner approval (plus
  `OPERATE OPENRAPPTER` for high-risk work), and cannot report recovery without
  real agent-tool evidence and post-operative verification.
- **Release channels** — `openrappter channel` manages stable and experimental
  rings, with isolated canary, nightly, alpha, and beta promotion.

### Changed

- **The Copilot CLI ships with the commit.** `@github/copilot` is a
  lockfile-pinned dependency resolved from this package's own `node_modules`
  rather than found on `PATH`, so its version is no longer decided by whoever
  last ran `copilot update`. Resolution order — explicit operator override,
  then the pinned copy, then ambient globals — is covered by tests.
- **The digest is re-checked before reuse.** The installer stamps the CLI's
  SHA-256 at build time and verifies it again before reusing an installation,
  so a binary substituted after install forces a rebuild instead of running.
- **`--status` names the binary that will actually answer**, instead of
  judging Copilot solely by `GITHUB_TOKEN` and reporting it unavailable while
  the gateway answered happily through the CLI backend.
- Installer digests are computed from the commit's git blob rather than the
  working tree, so a stale checkout or a local line-ending conversion cannot
  publish a hash for bytes that were never released.

### Fixed

- **HTTP RPC authentication** — token/password mode no longer trusts every
  loopback request implicitly; protected JSON-RPC and `/chat` calls now enforce
  configured credentials consistently with WebSocket authentication.
- `/twin` requires the same credential `/chat` requires, and `/agents/import`
  — which executes code — requires it too.
- A hatched twin shares the device, never a mouth: a channel alias cannot route
  around the registry, and a twin is told which mouths are not its own.
- A stale endpoint record is history, not an address; a name that never started
  is not answered for by someone else; a dead pid is not a serving process.
- An unknown `POST` path returns 404 rather than `200 "Received: …"`, and an
  over-cap request body is answered with 413 rather than a connection reset.
- A `--port` typed after a subcommand reaches that subcommand.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Dual-use binary classification** (RAI hardening, closes audit must-fix #3's mechanism) — `exec-safety.ts` now tags network-fetch/install/arbitrary-exec/permission binaries (`curl`, `wget`, `pip`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `node`, `python`, `tsx`, `chmod`, `chown`) via `DUAL_USE_BINS`; every `SafetyCheckResult` carries `dualUse` + `requiresApproval` so an approval layer can gate them (still `safe` under the default policy — backward-compatible). New opt-in `ExecSafety({ strictDefaults: true })` starts from the safe set minus dual-use binaries, so they return `safe: false, requiresApproval: true` unless explicitly re-added. Injection detection still precedes classification (a `curl … | sh` is blocked, not merely gated). `isDualUse()` helper; 6 new tests (suite 3109 → 3115).

### Added

- **Brainstem device-code auth** (kernel parity) — `POST /login` starts the GitHub device flow (same `COPILOT_CLIENT_ID` GitHub App as the RAPP kernel, producing `ghu_` tokens), `POST /login/poll` captures and persists the token in the kernel's `.copilot_token` JSON format (legacy plain-text reads supported), `GET /login/status` reports state. Token resolution: env → saved file → gh CLI (`gho_` OAuth tokens skipped — they 404 on the Copilot exchange, same lesson the kernel encodes). Copilot session now caches with `expires_at` + 60s buffer and re-exchanges when stale. 5 new auth-parity tests (Python suite 655 → 660).

### Added

- **OpenRappter Brainstem** (`python/openrappter/brainstem.py`, `python -m openrappter.brainstem`) — the local-device-first rappter: a stdlib-only (zero-dependency) HTTP server wire-compatible with the RAPP brainstem kernel so all training transfers. Same routes (`/chat`, `/health`, `/agents`, `/agents/import`, `/agents/export/<f>`, DELETE `/agents/<f>`, `/version`, `/models`), same JSON envelopes, same single-file agent contract with kernel-parity import shims (`agents.basic_agent` / `basic_agent` → OpenRappter's BasicAgent — the exact mirror of how the RAPP kernel shims `openrappter.agents.basic_agent`). Packaged OpenRappter agents form the default pool; user drop-ins in `~/.openrappter/brainstem/agents/` hot-load per request and override by name. `/chat` runs the Copilot tool loop (same token-exchange handshake as the kernel; `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth token`). Default port 7072 (`PORT=7071` for full drop-in). 8 wire-parity tests including a RAPP-authored agent dropping in unchanged and a full tool-loop round; verified live end-to-end with real Copilot on claude-sonnet-5. Also fixes a 30s `socket.getfqdn()` reverse-DNS hang per server bind on macOS.

### Added

- **Weighted sentiment words** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — `SENTIMENT_WORD_WEIGHTS` intensity tiers (mild 0.5 / strong 1.0; flat word lists now derive from the map, preserving membership for the negation counter and input-difficulty scorer); generated `analyzeSentiment()` scores by weight, so "amazing" moves the needle twice as far as "good" and three milds barely offset one strong. Behavioral test executes the actual generated method (brace-extracted from catalog output), not a recomputation.

### Added

- **Simpson's Diversity Index** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — generated `wordStats()` now reports `simpson_diversity` (1 − Σn(n−1)/N(N−1)) and `checkWordStats`'s `has_diversity` check uses it (threshold D >= 0.7, inclusive) instead of the raw unique/total ratio — repetition is weighted by frequency, so one dominant word is penalized even when many words are unique. E2E evolution test asserts the real generated capability emits valid entropy and Simpson values.

### Added

- **Character-level cipher verification** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — `checkCaesarCipher` gains a `char_shift_valid` check that verifies every character is shifted by exactly ROT13 (case preserved, punctuation passed through); a transform that merely roundtrips (e.g. string reversal) now fails. Cipher denominator 3 → 4 checks; 3 new tests.

### Added

- **Soul-to-soul communication** (Roadmap 1.2) — agents invoked through a soul now receive a `_soul` handle in kwargs (`{ id, chain, summon(rappterIds, message, mode) }`) that summons sibling souls through the manager. An ancestry chain rides every nested invocation: summon cycles (a → b → a) are blocked, depth is capped at `MAX_SOUL_SUMMON_DEPTH` (3), and souls loaded without a manager degrade gracefully. 4 new tests.

### Added

- **`rappter.create` RPC** (Roadmap 1.2) — create and load a soul from a natural-language description: name inferred via LearnNewAgent's keyword convention (explicit name wins), kebab-case id with collision suffixing, and an auto-derived `systemPrompt` so identity injection carries the persona to agents; `persist: true` saves the config. `RappterManager.createSoul()` + 6 new tests; rappter RPC surface now 13 methods.

### Added

- **RAPP brainstem drop-in compliance harness** (`python/tests/test_brainstem_compliance.py`) — proves every `*_agent.py` in `python/openrappter/agents/` runs when dropped into a rapp-installer brainstem (kody-w/rapp-installer, per rapp-spine). Replicates the kernel's `_load_agent_from_file` contract in a clean subprocess per agent: kernel `BasicAgent` (vendored verbatim as a fixture), import shims exactly as the brainstem registers them, zero-arg instantiation, registration by `instance.name`, and `to_tool()` for the /chat loop. Unshimmed `openrappter.*` imports fail exactly as they would in a real brainstem (validated with a negative control). Result: **12/12 agent files compliant**; 13 new tests.

- **Input difficulty scoring** (Roadmap 2.5, completes the quick-wins block) — `scoreInputDifficulty(input)` rates per capability whether the input gives it a fair chance (word/unique-word minimums, alphabetic content, pattern categories present, sentiment-bearing words), with reasons listing exactly what's missing; `EvolutionReport` now carries `input_difficulty` so a weak capability score can be attributed to unfair input instead of a broken capability. 8 new tests.

- **Per-capability trajectory tracking with confidence gating** (Roadmap 2.5) — `EvolutionLineage` now includes `capability_trajectories`: an independent regression slope per capability, where a direction (improving/declining) is only reported when `|slope| > 2 × standard error` with 3+ data points — noisy histories read as stable instead of falsely trending. New `computeCapabilityTrajectories()` export; shared `linearRegression()` helper now backs the overall trajectory too.

### Fixed

- **Shared-agent context clobbering in parallel summons** — souls built from the default pool share agent instances, and `BasicAgent.execute()` stores per-invocation context on the instance; parallel `all`/`race` summons let one soul's context (including `soul_identity`) overwrite another's mid-invocation. Executions are now serialized per agent instance inside `RappterSoul.invoke` (distinct agents still run fully parallel).

- **Soul identity injection** (Roadmap 1.2) — a soul's identity (id, name, description, emoji, systemPrompt, model) now flows into every agent invocation via data sloshing as `upstream_slush.soul_identity`; previously `systemPrompt` and `model` were stored on the config but never used
  - New `SoulIdentity` type; `RappterSoul.identity` getter; `RappterSoulStatus` now includes `systemPrompt`
  - In chain mode each soul injects its own identity; optional fields are omitted when unset
  - 4 new tests in `rappter-manager.test.ts` (suite now 3081 tests)

- **OuroborosAgent scoring quick wins** (Roadmap 2.5) — two capability-assessment upgrades
  - Lexical entropy: generated `wordStats()` now reports Shannon entropy over the word frequency distribution; `checkWordStats` gains a `lexical_entropy` check (threshold H >= 2.0), making trivially repetitive input fail
  - Negation handling: generated `analyzeSentiment()` flips polarity for sentiment words preceded by a negator within a 2-token window ("not good" scores negative) and reports flipped words in `negated`; `checkSentiment(s, inputText)` gains a `negation_handled` check that independently recomputes expected flips from the input
  - Shared sentiment vocabulary (`SENTIMENT_POSITIVE_WORDS`, `SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE_WORDS`, `SENTIMENT_NEGATORS`) exported as single source of truth for generated agents and the judge
  - Denominators: word stats 5 → 6 checks, sentiment 4 → 5 checks; ouroboros suite 81 → 86 tests

### Fixed

- All 8 outstanding ESLint warnings (unused imports/variables in `twin-methods.ts`, `pii.ts`, `index.ts`, and 2 test files) — lint is now warning-free

- **Soul config persistence hardening** (Roadmap 1.2) — persistence is now backed by a dedicated `SoulStore` (`gateway/soul-store.ts`) with filename-safe ID validation (blocks path traversal via `saveSoulConfig`), config shape validation on load, corrupt-file tolerance, and an injectable souls directory for tests
  - `RappterManager` persistence methods (`saveSoul`, `saveSoulConfig`, `deleteSavedSoul`, `listSavedSouls`, `loadSavedSouls`) now delegate to `SoulStore`; new `restoreSouls()` reports restored/skipped/failed IDs; `loadSoul` gains a `persist` option
  - 4 new RPC methods: `rappter.save`, `rappter.persisted`, `rappter.restore`, `rappter.forget` (save/restore/forget require auth)
  - Gateway startup restores all persisted souls after loading the default soul
  - `soul-store.test.ts` — 27 new tests (store, manager integration, RPC end-to-end)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Showcase #20: Agent Stock Exchange** — multi-round marketplace simulation where 3 analyst agents bid on 20 deterministic tasks across 4 categories (data/web/security/infra).
