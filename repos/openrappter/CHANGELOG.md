## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Python storage adapter is genuinely thread-safe** — `SqliteStorageAdapter`
  held an `RLock` (implying multi-threaded use) but opened its connection with
  sqlite3's default `check_same_thread=True`, so any call from a worker thread
  — a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, the gateway's executor, a cron worker — raised
  `sqlite3.ProgrammingError`. The connection is now opened with
  `check_same_thread=False` and every use of it, including cursor results and
  `rowcount`, is funnelled through a single lock-holding gate.
- **Browser private network access** — reaching a private or loopback address
  from the browser agent now requires an explicit operator opt-in
  (`allowPrivateNetwork`, off by default) rather than being reachable by
  default.
- **Full IPv6 link-local range blocked** — the SSRF guard covered only part of
  `fe80::/10`; the whole range is now rejected.
- **Allowlisted domains match on DNS-label boundaries** — `evil-example.com`
  no longer satisfies an allowlist entry of `example.com`.
- **Chunked downloads are bounded while they stream** — a declared length is
  not a promise, so the cap is enforced as bytes arrive rather than checked up
  front.
- **Cron job ids** — the scheduler sends the job id the gateway actually
  reads, and cron logs can no longer outlive or precede the job they belong
  to.
- **Shell exit codes** — Python returned `status=success` for every completed
  subprocess even on a nonzero exit, so `false` reported `return_code=1` while
  the shared classifier recorded success. Python now derives status from the
  return code; TypeScript already did.
- **Composite error status** — `AgentGraph` and `BroadcastManager` (both
  runtimes) only noticed a sub-agent failure when the call *threw*, so an agent
  that correctly reported `{"status": "error"}` was recorded as a success and
  the composite reported success overall. Both layers now classify through the
  shared `agentResultIsError` / `agent_result_is_error` helper, which also
  accepts an already-parsed envelope. A failed graph node now skips its
  dependents (or halts the graph under `stopOnError`); a broadcast keeps the
  full error envelope per branch but no longer counts it as a success, falls
  through to the next agent in `fallback` mode (forwarding the failed agent's
  `data_slush`), and never lets an error envelope win a `race`. Cross-runtime
  agreement is pinned by `contracts/agent-result-status-vectors.json`.
- **The rest of the composition layers had the same blind spot** — `AgentChain`,
  `PipelineAgent`, and `SubAgentManager` (both runtimes) also equated failure
  with a throw. A chain with `stopOnError` ran every remaining step past a step
  that returned `{"status": "error"}` and reported `partial` instead of `error`;
  `PipelineAgent` hard-coded every completed step to `status: 'success'`, so
  `onError` never fired at all and the pipeline reported `completed`; and
  `SubAgentManager` recorded a failed call as a success in its call history.
  All three now classify through the same shared helper. The failed payload is
  never discarded: the chain keeps the envelope as `finalResult`, the pipeline
  keeps each branch's result, and a sub-agent's error envelope is still returned
  to its caller (only the bookkeeping changes). The chain rollup also folds
  `{"status": "ERROR"}`, which its old case-sensitive comparison called success.
  A new `agentResultErrorMessage` / `agent_result_error_message` reports a failed
  step's reason identically whether the agent threw or returned an envelope, and
  is pinned by the same contract file.
- **The pipeline agent stays loadable without the kernel** — `pipeline_agent.py`
  is a single-file agent, so RAPP conformance R7 requires it to load with no
  kernel import at all. Its use of the shared classifier is a guarded import
  (the pattern `shell_agent.py` already uses) with a local fallback that mirrors
  the shared implementation verbatim; the two are pinned against each other over
  every contract vector by a test that loads the agent with no `openrappter`
  package present.
- **`config` and `doctor` were never registered** — both were implemented and
  exported, but their words fell through to chat and global help while shipped
  health guidance told you to run them. Registering them exposed dormant bugs:
  `get`/`set` no longer echo credential values, validation strictly parses both
  config files against the real schema, and `doctor` returns nonzero for failed
  checks in JSON mode too.
- **`voice-call` skill** prescribed `call start`, `call end` and
  `call conference`, none of which exist, and required a legacy plugin switch
  no OpenRappter code reads. It now documents the flow that ships.

### Changed

- The Electron desktop is the authority for OpenRappter Bar authentication,
  and desktop smoke tests were hardened for concurrent and Windows runs.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Show-and-Tell mode** in TypeScript and Python — record a real workflow,
  reconstruct its intent and ordered semantic steps, review it, and build a
  portable `SKILL.md`, a disabled automation, or both.
- **Cross-runtime recording store** — a private SQLite WAL database gives
  TypeScript and Python the same session, event, analysis, consent, and artifact
  contract with transactionally allocated event order.
- **Detached context collectors** — macOS, Windows, and Linux adapters capture
  active app/window context after the CLI exits. Browser URLs lose query and
  fragment data, and screenshots are explicit-only.
- **Local consent boundaries** — recording, optional Copilot analysis,
  approval, and deletion each require a short-lived, one-use token issued by an
  interactive local terminal.
- **Safe workflow packaging** — generated skills include manifests understood
  by both runtimes; automations are disabled by default; replay is a dry run
  rather than coordinate playback.
- **Electron desktop shell** — packages the current OpenRappter UI and runtime
  behind a sandboxed, context-isolated renderer, launches or reuses the local
  gateway, and adds a visual Skill Recorder-style Show-and-Tell workspace.
- **Native desktop consent** — recording, scoped active-window capture,
  workflow approval, and deletion use Electron main-process confirmation
  dialogs; consent tokens and filesystem paths never reach the renderer.
- **Chat-driven desktop control** — the `DesktopControl` agent snapshots the
  composed shadow-DOM UI and drives navigation, clicks, fields, selection,
  scrolling, and waits through semantic refs while the user watches.
- **Approved agent injection** — `.py` and `*_agent.ts` sources can be supplied
  through chat, capability-scanned, hash-disclosed, natively approved, compiled
  when needed, verified by loading, and hot-added to the live assistant.
- **On-device narration** — Whisper Small q8 downloads once (~252 MB), records
  optional microphone narration, transcribes locally, and adds the transcript
  to the active Show-and-Tell timeline.
- **On-device voice preview** — pinned Microsoft VibeVoice Realtime 0.5B source
  and model (~2.04 GB weights) self-bootstrap into a private Python 3.11
  environment and loopback-only server; VibeVoice generated WAV audio
  successfully on Apple MPS.
- **Unified tray and Bar** — Electron provides quick chat/recording/voice tray
  actions and publishes a private authenticated endpoint that the Swift
  OpenRappter Bar prefers over launching a competing gateway.

### Security

- Typed ComputerUse text is represented only by length, never content.
- Credential- and sign-in-looking windows refuse screenshot capture.
- Raw frames and frame paths are never sent to Copilot; only the separately
  approved privacy-safe textual event summary can leave the machine.
- Session roots, databases, frames, skills, manifests, and automation bundles
  use owner-only permissions and reject symlinked destinations.
- Electron carries an isolated packed runtime and Electron-ABI SQLite binding;
  the system Node binding is never rebuilt or shared.
- The desktop gateway uses a random per-process bearer token and a dedicated
  loopback port. The endpoint file is private, bounded, and removed only by its
  owning process.
- VibeVoice is an opt-in preview with explicit responsible-use disclosure; the
  server is loopback-only, access logs are disabled, text is bounded, and
  source/model/tokenizer revisions are pinned.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Provider-neutral Flight Recorder** in TypeScript and Python — a local
  SQLite WAL ledger records correlated trace, context, provider, tool, and
  agent lifecycle events under `openrappter-event/1.0`.
- **Privacy-safe defaults** — raw prompts, responses, tool arguments, and file
  contents are omitted unless explicitly enabled. Opt-in IO is recursively
  scrubbed for secret keys, secret-shaped values, sensitive paths, circular
  values, unsafe numbers, and bounded by a post-redaction byte cap.
- **Integrity-checked replay bundles** — versioned
  `openrappter-flight-export/1.0` export/import with SHA-256 event hashes,
  atomic tamper rejection, durable sequence continuity, and a committed
  TypeScript/Python golden vector.
- **Flight Recorder CLI** — `flight status`, `events`, `export`, `import`, and
  confirmation-gated `clear`.
- **Release-enforced cross-runtime gate** — behavior, mutation, privacy,
  causality, retention, package, TypeScript, and Python validation now block
  release artifact publication.

### Changed

- Provider responses may report the concrete model that actually answered;
  `auto` remains a routing policy in metadata instead of being persisted as a
  false model identity.
- Retention prunes whole completed traces and preserves active traces rather
  than leaving replay fragments without their start/context events. Nested and
  resumed activity is evaluated by lifecycle depth in trace sequence order.
- Replay exports read one uncapped SQLite snapshot, while interactive queries
  retain their 10,000-event safety cap.
- Trace sequence allocation reloads after cross-process SQLite conflicts, and
  long-trace recovery uses one descending lookup rather than capped paging.
  Lifecycle durations use monotonic clocks rather than wall time.
- Absolute workspace paths are persisted as stable SHA-256 scope identifiers,
  not raw filesystem paths.
- Session identifiers are persisted as stable SHA-256 scope identifiers so
  channel keys cannot leak phone numbers, email addresses, or chat GUIDs.
  A private per-installation HMAC key prevents offline dictionary reversal.

### Security

- Persisted error metadata contains only safe class/code/status, message hash,
  and message length. Raw provider response bodies remain opt-in payload data.
- Flight databases, live WAL/SHM sidecars, and atomically replaced export
  bundles use private filesystem modes. Custom database paths do not chmod
  caller-owned parent directories.
- Session/channel identifiers are normalized at the recorder boundary, and
  Python query aliases reject unknown filters instead of silently exporting an
  over-broad history.
- Secret-shaped and excluded-path property names are replaced with
  collision-safe markers before hashing or persistence; contents under
  excluded filenames such as `.pem`, `.p12`, and service-account files are
  removed.
- Direct provider calls in telephony, Surgeon, LearnNew, Ouroboros, and
  iMessage readiness checks now emit the same provider lifecycle evidence as
  Assistant turns.
- The Copilot CLI MCP child initializes its own recorder, streaming preserves
  provider-reported model identity, and unknown fallback models remain
  explicitly unattributed.
- Copilot CLI child tools inherit the originating trace/parent scope and record
  a tool-to-agent causal subtree rather than a disconnected child trace.
- Standalone records evict sequence caches, and explicit recorder installation
  remains synchronized with environment bootstrap.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **One device, many rappters** — an *alpha* holds the default port and the
  device's channels, and any number of *hatched twins* run beside it, each with
  its own identity, port, and lock. `openrappter hatch <name>`,
  `openrappter twins`, and `--instance <id>` address them.
- **Twin-to-twin chat** — a rappter can speak to a peer, not only be spoken to.
  `POST /twin` carries the `rapp-twin-chat/1.0` envelope, and a peer that
  speaks `/chat` but not `/twin` is still reachable.
- **Neighbourhood and roster** — a running rappter can reach a neighbour, tells
  its neighbours which twin it is, and is judged by the same name the roster
  calls it.
- **Copilot Surgeon primary interface** — replaces the static dashboard landing
  page with an adaptive operating room where OpenRappter is the patient and
  GitHub Copilot shapes each next interaction from live, sanitized patient
  anatomy. Existing operational pages remain available as secondary anatomy.
- **Consent-bound procedures** — Copilot proposals are persisted with an
  immutable SHA-256 digest, require explicit owner approval (plus
  `OPERATE OPENRAPPTER` for high-risk work), and cannot report recovery without
  real agent-tool evidence and post-operative verification.
- **Release channels** — `openrappter channel` manages stable and experimental
  rings, with isolated canary, nightly, alpha, and beta promotion.

### Changed

- **The Copilot CLI ships with the commit.** `@github/copilot` is a
  lockfile-pinned dependency resolved from this package's own `node_modules`
  rather than found on `PATH`, so its version is no longer decided by whoever
  last ran `copilot update`. Resolution order — explicit operator override,
  then the pinned copy, then ambient globals — is covered by tests.
- **The digest is re-checked before reuse.** The installer stamps the CLI's
  SHA-256 at build time and verifies it again before reusing an installation,
  so a binary substituted after install forces a rebuild instead of running.
- **`--status` names the binary that will actually answer**, instead of
  judging Copilot solely by `GITHUB_TOKEN` and reporting it unavailable while
  the gateway answered happily through the CLI backend.
- Installer digests are computed from the commit's git blob rather than the
  working tree, so a stale checkout or a local line-ending conversion cannot
  publish a hash for bytes that were never released.

### Fixed

- **HTTP RPC authentication** — token/password mode no longer trusts every
  loopback request implicitly; protected JSON-RPC and `/chat` calls now enforce
  configured credentials consistently with WebSocket authentication.
- `/twin` requires the same credential `/chat` requires, and `/agents/import`
  — which executes code — requires it too.
- A hatched twin shares the device, never a mouth: a channel alias cannot route
  around the registry, and a twin is told which mouths are not its own.
- A stale endpoint record is history, not an address; a name that never started
  is not answered for by someone else; a dead pid is not a serving process.
- An unknown `POST` path returns 404 rather than `200 "Received: …"`, and an
  over-cap request body is answered with 413 rather than a connection reset.
- A `--port` typed after a subcommand reaches that subcommand.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Dual-use binary classification** (RAI hardening, closes audit must-fix #3's mechanism) — `exec-safety.ts` now tags network-fetch/install/arbitrary-exec/permission binaries (`curl`, `wget`, `pip`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `node`, `python`, `tsx`, `chmod`, `chown`) via `DUAL_USE_BINS`; every `SafetyCheckResult` carries `dualUse` + `requiresApproval` so an approval layer can gate them (still `safe` under the default policy — backward-compatible). New opt-in `ExecSafety({ strictDefaults: true })` starts from the safe set minus dual-use binaries, so they return `safe: false, requiresApproval: true` unless explicitly re-added. Injection detection still precedes classification (a `curl … | sh` is blocked, not merely gated). `isDualUse()` helper; 6 new tests (suite 3109 → 3115).

### Added

- **Brainstem device-code auth** (kernel parity) — `POST /login` starts the GitHub device flow (same `COPILOT_CLIENT_ID` GitHub App as the RAPP kernel, producing `ghu_` tokens), `POST /login/poll` captures and persists the token in the kernel's `.copilot_token` JSON format (legacy plain-text reads supported), `GET /login/status` reports state. Token resolution: env → saved file → gh CLI (`gho_` OAuth tokens skipped — they 404 on the Copilot exchange, same lesson the kernel encodes). Copilot session now caches with `expires_at` + 60s buffer and re-exchanges when stale. 5 new auth-parity tests (Python suite 655 → 660).

### Added

- **OpenRappter Brainstem** (`python/openrappter/brainstem.py`, `python -m openrappter.brainstem`) — the local-device-first rappter: a stdlib-only (zero-dependency) HTTP server wire-compatible with the RAPP brainstem kernel so all training transfers. Same routes (`/chat`, `/health`, `/agents`, `/agents/import`, `/agents/export/<f>`, DELETE `/agents/<f>`, `/version`, `/models`), same JSON envelopes, same single-file agent contract with kernel-parity import shims (`agents.basic_agent` / `basic_agent` → OpenRappter's BasicAgent — the exact mirror of how the RAPP kernel shims `openrappter.agents.basic_agent`). Packaged OpenRappter agents form the default pool; user drop-ins in `~/.openrappter/brainstem/agents/` hot-load per request and override by name. `/chat` runs the Copilot tool loop (same token-exchange handshake as the kernel; `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `gh auth token`). Default port 7072 (`PORT=7071` for full drop-in). 8 wire-parity tests including a RAPP-authored agent dropping in unchanged and a full tool-loop round; verified live end-to-end with real Copilot on claude-sonnet-5. Also fixes a 30s `socket.getfqdn()` reverse-DNS hang per server bind on macOS.

### Added

- **Weighted sentiment words** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — `SENTIMENT_WORD_WEIGHTS` intensity tiers (mild 0.5 / strong 1.0; flat word lists now derive from the map, preserving membership for the negation counter and input-difficulty scorer); generated `analyzeSentiment()` scores by weight, so "amazing" moves the needle twice as far as "good" and three milds barely offset one strong. Behavioral test executes the actual generated method (brace-extracted from catalog output), not a recomputation.

### Added

- **Simpson's Diversity Index** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — generated `wordStats()` now reports `simpson_diversity` (1 − Σn(n−1)/N(N−1)) and `checkWordStats`'s `has_diversity` check uses it (threshold D >= 0.7, inclusive) instead of the raw unique/total ratio — repetition is weighted by frequency, so one dominant word is penalized even when many words are unique. E2E evolution test asserts the real generated capability emits valid entropy and Simpson values.

### Added

- **Character-level cipher verification** (Roadmap 2.5 graduated scoring) — `checkCaesarCipher` gains a `char_shift_valid` check that verifies every character is shifted by exactly ROT13 (case preserved, punctuation passed through); a transform that merely roundtrips (e.g. string reversal) now fails. Cipher denominator 3 → 4 checks; 3 new tests.

### Added

- **Soul-to-soul communication** (Roadmap 1.2) — agents invoked through a soul now receive a `_soul` handle in kwargs (`{ id, chain, summon(rappterIds, message, mode) }`) that summons sibling souls through the manager. An ancestry chain rides every nested invocation: summon cycles (a → b → a) are blocked, depth is capped at `MAX_SOUL_SUMMON_DEPTH` (3), and souls loaded without a manager degrade gracefully. 4 new tests.

### Added

- **`rappter.create` RPC** (Roadmap 1.2) — create and load a soul from a natural-language description: name inferred via LearnNewAgent's keyword convention (explicit name wins), kebab-case id with collision suffixing, and an auto-derived `systemPrompt` so identity injection carries the persona to agents; `persist: true` saves the config. `RappterManager.createSoul()` + 6 new tests; rappter RPC surface now 13 methods.

### Added

- **RAPP brainstem drop-in compliance harness** (`python/tests/test_brainstem_compliance.py`) — proves every `*_agent.py` in `python/openrappter/agents/` runs when dropped into a rapp-installer brainstem (kody-w/rapp-installer, per rapp-spine). Replicates the kernel's `_load_agent_from_file` contract in a clean subprocess per agent: kernel `BasicAgent` (vendored verbatim as a fixture), import shims exactly as the brainstem registers them, zero-arg instantiation, registration by `instance.name`, and `to_tool()` for the /chat loop. Unshimmed `openrappter.*` imports fail exactly as they would in a real brainstem (validated with a negative control). Result: **12/12 agent files compliant**; 13 new tests.

- **Input difficulty scoring** (Roadmap 2.5, completes the quick-wins block) — `scoreInputDifficulty(input)` rates per capability whether the input gives it a fair chance (word/unique-word minimums, alphabetic content, pattern categories present, sentiment-bearing words), with reasons listing exactly what's missing; `EvolutionReport` now carries `input_difficulty` so a weak capability score can be attributed to unfair input instead of a broken capability. 8 new tests.

- **Per-capability trajectory tracking with confidence gating** (Roadmap 2.5) — `EvolutionLineage` now includes `capability_trajectories`: an independent regression slope per capability, where a direction (improving/declining) is only reported when `|slope| > 2 × standard error` with 3+ data points — noisy histories read as stable instead of falsely trending. New `computeCapabilityTrajectories()` export; shared `linearRegression()` helper now backs the overall trajectory too.

### Fixed

- **Shared-agent context clobbering in parallel summons** — souls built from the default pool share agent instances, and `BasicAgent.execute()` stores per-invocation context on the instance; parallel `all`/`race` summons let one soul's context (including `soul_identity`) overwrite another's mid-invocation. Executions are now serialized per agent instance inside `RappterSoul.invoke` (distinct agents still run fully parallel).

- **Soul identity injection** (Roadmap 1.2) — a soul's identity (id, name, description, emoji, systemPrompt, model) now flows into every agent invocation via data sloshing as `upstream_slush.soul_identity`; previously `systemPrompt` and `model` were stored on the config but never used
  - New `SoulIdentity` type; `RappterSoul.identity` getter; `RappterSoulStatus` now includes `systemPrompt`
  - In chain mode each soul injects its own identity; optional fields are omitted when unset
  - 4 new tests in `rappter-manager.test.ts` (suite now 3081 tests)

- **OuroborosAgent scoring quick wins** (Roadmap 2.5) — two capability-assessment upgrades
  - Lexical entropy: generated `wordStats()` now reports Shannon entropy over the word frequency distribution; `checkWordStats` gains a `lexical_entropy` check (threshold H >= 2.0), making trivially repetitive input fail
  - Negation handling: generated `analyzeSentiment()` flips polarity for sentiment words preceded by a negator within a 2-token window ("not good" scores negative) and reports flipped words in `negated`; `checkSentiment(s, inputText)` gains a `negation_handled` check that independently recomputes expected flips from the input
  - Shared sentiment vocabulary (`SENTIMENT_POSITIVE_WORDS`, `SENTIMENT_NEGATIVE_WORDS`, `SENTIMENT_NEGATORS`) exported as single source of truth for generated agents and the judge
  - Denominators: word stats 5 → 6 checks, sentiment 4 → 5 checks; ouroboros suite 81 → 86 tests

### Fixed

- All 8 outstanding ESLint warnings (unused imports/variables in `twin-methods.ts`, `pii.ts`, `index.ts`, and 2 test files) — lint is now warning-free

- **Soul config persistence hardening** (Roadmap 1.2) — persistence is now backed by a dedicated `SoulStore` (`gateway/soul-store.ts`) with filename-safe ID validation (blocks path traversal via `saveSoulConfig`), config shape validation on load, corrupt-file tolerance, and an injectable souls directory for tests
  - `RappterManager` persistence methods (`saveSoul`, `saveSoulConfig`, `deleteSavedSoul`, `listSavedSouls`, `loadSavedSouls`) now delegate to `SoulStore`; new `restoreSouls()` reports restored/skipped/failed IDs; `loadSoul` gains a `persist` option
  - 4 new RPC methods: `rappter.save`, `rappter.persisted`, `rappter.restore`, `rappter.forget` (save/restore/forget require auth)
  - Gateway startup restores all persisted souls after loading the default soul
  - `soul-store.test.ts` — 27 new tests (store, manager integration, RPC end-to-end)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-22

  - `last_data_slush` (Python) / `lastDataSlush` (TypeScript) property on `BasicAgent` for accessing the most recent output
  - `upstream_slush` kwarg on `execute()` — automatically merged into `self.context['upstream_slush']` for downstream agents
  - Enables LLM-free agent chaining in sub-agent pipelines, cron jobs, and broadcast patterns
- `WeatherPoetAgent` — example agent demonstrating data_slush with live weather API integration and haiku generation
- `upstream_slush` field added to `AgentContext` type (TypeScript)
