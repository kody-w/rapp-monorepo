# Send an iMessage attachment that actually arrives.
#
#   send-attachment.sh <recipient> <file> [message-file]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `send <alias> to <buddy>` in AppleScript returns cleanly and creates a real
# row in chat.db, but the attachment silently never transfers: the row lands
# with is_sent=0, error=25, transfer_state=6, and attachment.filename is left
# pointing at the source path instead of being rewritten into the Messages
# store. Twenty-four consecutive catch-up videos failed this way.
#
# The cause is not AppleScript, the recipient, the file size, or the file type.
# It is `imagent`, the daemon that performs the transfer. Streaming its log
# during a send shows, eight times per attempt:
#
#   imagent (libcopyfile.dylib) open on /tmp/r21a.mp4: Operation not permitted
#
# EPERM, not EACCES — a sandbox refusal rather than a POSIX mode problem; the
# file was 0644 and world-readable. imagent is sandboxed and carries no general
# file-read grant. Its entitlements do include kTCCServicePhotos and
# kTCCServiceMediaLibrary, which cover ~/Pictures, and that is the whole of the
# rule. Measured, one send per location:
#
#   ~/Pictures      sent=1 error=0   (twice, and the filename was rewritten
#                                     into ~/Library/Messages/Attachments)
#   /tmp            sent=0 error=25
#   ~/Desktop       sent=0 error=25
#   ~/Documents     sent=0 error=25
#   ~/Downloads     sent=0 error=25
#   ~/Movies        sent=0 error=25
#   /Users/Shared   sent=0 error=25
#
# So: stage the file inside ~/Pictures, send it from there, then remove it.
#
# There is no permission toggle for this. imagent is an Apple system daemon and
# does not appear in Full Disk Access; there is no Files-and-Folders entry for
# it or for Messages. Granting Terminal or the calling process more access
# changes nothing, because the process that cannot open the file is imagent.
#
# This is also why sending by hand always worked: dragging a file into the
# Messages window hands imagent a powerbox grant for that specific file, which
# an AppleScript send never obtains.
