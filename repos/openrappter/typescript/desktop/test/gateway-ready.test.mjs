 * The gateway readiness handshake, driven rather than described.
 *
 * Desktop startup hangs on this one promise: the app either sees its gateway
 * report ready, or it does not launch. Until now it lived inside
 * `ensureGateway` in `main.ts`, which imports `electron` and so cannot be
 * loaded by `node --test` — which is why the desktop suite asserts that file as
 * text. The security property ("accept readiness only from our own child") was
 * pinned by a regex over the source and never once executed.
 *
 * These tests supply a fake child and check what the handshake actually does.
