/**
 * Talking to the local brainstem from the OpenRappter gateway.
 *
 * The brainstem (`python -m openrappter.brainstem`) is a separate process
 * speaking HTTP `POST /chat`, while the gateway speaks WebSocket `chat.send`.
 * Historically that meant two chat windows to hold one conversation across two
 * brains. It does not have to: both runtimes return the *same* frozen envelope
 * — `rapp-runtime-parity/1.0` §2.4 — so a reply from either can be rendered by
 * the same client without translation.
 *
 * This module is the client half. It is deliberately free of gateway state so
 * it can be tested by handing it a fetch, which is the only way to prove what
 * it does when the brainstem is missing, slow, or answering something that is
 * not an envelope.
