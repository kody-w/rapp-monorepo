/**
 * The `rapp-twin-chat/1.0` envelope. — kody-w/openrappter#96
 *
 * A device runs an alpha rappter plus any number of hatched twins, and through
 * a neighborhood they interact over `/twin` and `/chat` without any of them
 * knowing whether a peer is a rappter, a brainstem, or a person. `/chat` is the
 * turn; this is the envelope that carries a turn *between named peers*.
 *
 * Shapes are `rapp-neighborhood-protocol/1.0` §6a (request) and §6e (response).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY REFUSES
 *
 * `console` operates a neighbor's runtime and is SEALED-ONLY (§8/§11). The
 * sealed codec is `rapp-sealed/1.0`, which rides the envelope inside a signed
 * `{ts, kind, body, sig}` and needs ECDSA-P256. This gateway implements none of
 * it, so a `console` envelope is refused outright. Accepting an unsealed one —
 * or worse, executing it — would be the single worst thing this endpoint could
 * do, and "we'll add the seal later" is exactly how that ships.
 *
 * ECDSA-P256 is sourced: `rapp-sentinel/neighborhood.py` describes the same
 * codec and the same requirement, and refuses for the same reason — "it rejects
 * `console` kind outright rather than pretending to seal it … it is a gap, and
 * it is written down rather than glossed." Two implementations refusing on the
 * same stated grounds is corroboration, not coincidence.
 *
 * This comment previously also named a "PBKDF2 channel key". That could not be
 * sourced anywhere — not in `SPEC-rapp1.md`, not in `neighborhood.py`, not in
 * any document on this machine — and no copy of `rapp-neighborhood-protocol/1.0`
 * is present to confirm or deny it. A comment naming a cryptographic primitive
 * is a specification to whoever implements it next, so an unsourceable one is
 * removed rather than left to be built. If the protocol does require a derived
 * channel key, that belongs here with a citation. #124
 *
 * Do not reach for `SPEC-rapp1.md` §10 when implementing this. That specifies
 * JWS (detached, unencoded, EdDSA or ES256) with key discovery through the §13
 * registry, and it governs FRAMES ON STREAMS — a different layer from the
 * `console` envelope. Its verifier must also refuse on registry absence, and no
 * `rapp-map/ecosystem-spec.json` exists here, so on that layer refusing is the
 * specified outcome too. Two layers, two mechanisms; conflating them sends an
 * implementer to the wrong one.
 *
 * Nothing here verifies a signature, and nothing here should be read as having
 * authenticated the sender. `from_rappid` is a claim, not proof.
