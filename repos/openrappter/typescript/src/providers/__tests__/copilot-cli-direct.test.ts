/**
 * The daemon must still find the Copilot CLI when nobody started it from a shell.
 *
 * Scope note: error *content* is covered by the surgeon commit's own classifier
 * tests in `../copilot-cli-direct.test.ts`. What is asserted here is the part
 * that fix did not address — locating the CLI at all.
 *
 * The defect these cover, reproduced exactly before the fix:
 *
 *     Command failed: …/github.copilot-chat/copilotCli/copilot -p <identity>…
 *     stderr: Cannot find GitHub Copilot CLI
 *     stdout: Install GitHub Copilot CLI? ['y/N']
 *     …after 23.5s
 *
 * Three separate faults produced that one red box:
 *
 *  1. `findCLI()` preferred the VS Code entry, which is not the CLI — it is a
 *     300-byte shim that shells `copilot --version` to find the real binary. So
 *     it only works when the real CLI is *also* on PATH.
 *  2. A menu-bar app launched from Finder inherits launchd's PATH
 *     (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), and `ProcessManager` spawns the daemon
 *     without setting `environment`, so `/opt/homebrew/bin` was unreachable.
 *  3. `execFile` leaves stdin open, so the shim's `['y/N']` prompt blocked until
 *     the timeout instead of failing fast.
 *
 * And the message printed the entire argv — leaking the system prompt into the
 * UI while burying the stderr that actually explained the problem.
