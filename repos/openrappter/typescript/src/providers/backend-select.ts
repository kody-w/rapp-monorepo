/**
 * Pick a provider that can actually answer, and say so when none can.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR
 *
 * openrappter defaulted to the Copilot **SDK**, which needs a GitHub token
 * carrying Copilot API access. On a machine where that token is missing, fake,
 * or unentitled, every message came back as:
 *
 *     GitHub token does not have Copilot API access (HTTP 401/403).
 *
 * …while a fully working GitHub Copilot **CLI** sat on the same disk, holding
 * its own credential and answering fine. The product had a path that worked and
 * was choosing one that did not, then reporting the failure as if nothing could
 * be done. That is the opposite of local-first degradation.
 *
 * It also proceeded past a credential it had already observed to be bad — the
 * daemon logged `Stored Copilot profile is stale` and then carried on to fail
 * on the next request. A known-bad credential is a decision point, not a
 * warning to print.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 *
 * Probes the ladder once at startup, cheaply, and picks the first rung that
 * actually works:
 *
 *   1. an explicit `OPENRAPPTER_AI_BACKEND` — the operator's choice always wins
 *   2. the Copilot SDK, but only if its token really exchanges for a Copilot
 *      API token; a token that merely EXISTS is not evidence it works
 *   3. the Copilot CLI, if the binary is present and authenticated
 *   4. nothing — and in that case the reason is carried, in words that name the
 *      action a person can take
 *
 * Rung 4 matters as much as the others. When no provider can answer, the UI has
 * to say "your Copilot sign-in expired — reconnect", not echo a command line.
