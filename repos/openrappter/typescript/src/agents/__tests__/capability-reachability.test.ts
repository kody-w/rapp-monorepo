/**
 * An agent must not declare a capability it cannot reach.
 *
 * `conformance.py` enforces this as R5 — "No agent over-declares a capability
 * it cannot reach" — but R5 walks `agent_files()`, which its own docstring
 * describes as "Python agents only". No TypeScript agent had ever been checked.
 *
 * Three were wrong, all the same way. `DocScannerAgent`, `NotesIntakeAgent`
 * and `WebAgent` declared `process-exec` while importing no `child_process` at
 * all; what they contain is regular-expression `.exec()` calls. The two
 * scanners additionally declared `filesystem-write` while importing only
 * `readdir`, `stat` and `readFile`. Read-only scanners held the two most
 * dangerous capabilities in the vocabulary.
 *
 * Over-declaration is the mirror of the under-declaration in #244, and it
 * costs the same thing: a capability that does not mean what it says cannot be
 * used to make a decision. A policy denying `process-exec` would refuse three
 * agents that only match text.
 *
 * SCOPE, deliberately narrow. Evidence is read from the agent's own file, so
 * this can only speak for agents whose imports are all Node builtins — an
 * agent that delegates through a local module may reach a capability this file
 * cannot see. Those are excluded from the assertion rather than guessed at,
 * and counted below so the exclusion cannot quietly grow to cover everything.

/**
 * Evidence that a capability is reachable, mirroring CAPABILITY_EVIDENCE.
 *
 * These patterns are the security-critical core of this file, and until now
 * nothing tested them directly — they were only ever exercised against
 * whichever agents happened to exist, so a gap could sit here indefinitely
 * without a single test going red. Fourteen of fifteen realistic
 * `filesystem-write` forms were invisible, including `fs.rm(dir, {recursive:
 * true})`, the async twin of the `rmSync` the table already listed. The
 * `\b...\b` word boundary also meant `rename` did not match `renameSync` and
 * `copyFile` did not match `copyFileSync`, because the `S` that follows is a
 * word character. Those forms are used 71 times elsewhere in `typescript/src`;
 * it was luck, not design, that no self-contained agent had reached for one.
 *
 * The list is now built from verb + optional `Sync` so a twin cannot go
 * missing again, and the classifier has unit tests of its own below.
 *
 * `rm` and `cp` are matched only in call position, since two letters are too
 * little to spend a false positive on. Bare `link` is deliberately absent for
 * the same reason — it is far more likely to be a markup helper than
 * `fs.link`, and `symlink` covers the case that matters. A false positive here
 * would push someone to declare a capability they do not have, which is the
 * exact disease this file exists to treat.

 *
 * Dynamic imports count. This used to read static `import ... from` lines only,
 * which meant `await import('../infra/gateway-lock.js')` was invisible to it —
 * the very same specifier that disqualifies a file when written statically.
 * Three of the thirteen agents this asserted against reached deep internals
 * that way (`CronAgent` into `../cron/service.js`, `TTSAgent` into
 * `../voice/tts.js`, and `NeighborAgent` into nine modules under `../infra`
 * and `../twin`), so the file claimed "the source is the whole story" about
 * files whose story continued somewhere it never looked. No live
 * mis-declaration was hiding there — each one calls a pure helper — but the
 * assertions were resting on a premise that was not true, which is the kind of
 * thing that holds until it suddenly doesn't.
 *
 * A dynamic import with a computed specifier is excluded outright: if the
 * target is only known at runtime, nothing here can say what it reaches. No
 * agent in this directory does that today, but `morning_brief_agent.js` loads
 * siblings by `import(path.join(...))`, so the shape is not hypothetical.
