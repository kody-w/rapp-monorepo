/**
 * One answer to "is this field name a secret?".
 *
 * There were two, and each missed what the other caught:
 *
 *   config display    token password key secret apikey api_key
 *   gateway logging   token password secret credential authorization
 *
 * So `apiKey`, `privateKey`, `signingKey` and `sessionKey` were written to the
 * structured log in the clear, while `credential`, `credentials` and
 * `authorization` were printed in the clear by `config show`. Two lists, two
 * different holes, neither visible from the other file.
 *
 * Matching is on word boundaries rather than substrings, so `apiKey` and
 * `private_key` are caught while `monkey` and `keyword` are not — the previous
 * config list redacted both of those by accident, which is harmless for display
 * but would blank useful fields if the same list were used for logs.
