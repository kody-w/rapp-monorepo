/**
 * The reply composer.
 *
 * These tests exist because of a real thread. The agent was awake, polling,
 * deciding correctly and sending — and it answered "Okay well list 10 things
 * you can do" by repeating its own greeting, twice, having never looked at the
 * text. Every safety rule passed. Nothing checked that an answer was an answer.
 *
 * So: a model is injected here rather than called. What is under test is whether
 * the message reaches it, whether the reply is shaped for a text message, and
 * whether the things that must never reach a model still never do.
