/**
 * What the agent actually says back to a person who texts the number.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS TO FIX
 *
 * The watcher could read an inbox, decide correctly, and send — and then said
 * the same fixed sentence to everybody, forever. A real thread looked like this:
 *
 *   them  10:43  What else
 *   us    10:45  This is an openrappter agent on this number. It read your
 *                message and can answer, negotiate against limits its owner
 *                set, or hand off when a reply needs a person.
 *   them  10:50  Okay well list 10 things you can do
 *   them  11:14  You there?
 *   us    11:20  This is an openrappter agent on this number. It read your …
 *
 * Every safety rule worked. The agent was awake, it was polling, it was
 * replying, and it answered a direct question by repeating its own greeting
 * twice. "It read your message" was, strictly, a lie: nothing ever looked at
 * the text.
 *
 * So this module is the missing half — the part that composes an answer.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO
 *
 *   - answer automated senders. A verification code is not a conversation, and
 *     quoting one back puts a security code in a thread it was never meant to
 *     leave. That check runs before the model is ever consulted.
 *   - speak as the owner. It is the owner's agent, not the owner, and it never
 *     commits them to anything.
 *   - invent capabilities. Asked what it can do with no roster injected, it
 *     says what it is rather than listing features nobody verified.
 *   - emit markdown. Asterisks and backticks are noise in a text message.
 *
 * And if the model cannot be reached at all, it falls back to the greeting —
 * which is the right thing to say once, and was only ever wrong as an answer to
 * everything.
