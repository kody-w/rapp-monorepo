/**
 * Google Voice — the on-device fallback, with no API keys at all.
 *
 * An honest note about what this can and cannot do, because getting it wrong
 * would mean the agent claiming a conversation that never happened:
 *
 *   Google Voice has no programmable audio path. A "call" there bridges *your*
 *   phone to the callee. So over Google Voice the agent CANNOT speak or listen
 *   on a voice call.
 *
 *   What it CAN do, fully autonomously, is text. Google Voice SMS is readable
 *   and writable from a signed-in browser session, and the negotiation loop is
 *   identical over text: `say` sends a message, `listen` waits for the reply,
 *   and `decide()` still decides. The agent really can book the table by SMS
 *   with no account, no key and nothing leaving the machine except the message.
 *
 *   For voice it offers a `handoff`: it places the call and connects the owner,
 *   and records it as a handoff — never as something the agent did itself.
 *
 * It drives the owner's real, already-signed-in browser session, so there is no
 * credential to store here. The account is configuration
 * (`GOOGLE_VOICE_ACCOUNT`), never a hardcoded value in this repo.
 *
 * The driver this is written against now has a real implementation:
 * `GoogleVoiceBrowserDriver` in ./google-voice-browser.ts, which attaches to the
 * owner's Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. Before that this file described a
 * capability nothing could perform — the only `GoogleVoiceDriver` in the tree
 * was a fake inside a test.
