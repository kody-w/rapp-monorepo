/**
 * Google Voice, driven in the owner's own browser — the free phone layer.
 *
 * This is the implementation `GoogleVoiceProvider` has always been written
 * against and never had. Until now `GoogleVoiceDriver` was a type with exactly
 * one implementation, a fake inside a test, so the on-device path could be
 * reasoned about but never dialled.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * Every other voice backend bills per minute and wants an account, a key, and a
 * copy of the conversation. The owner already has a phone number that costs
 * nothing, and a browser already signed into it. This reaches that, so the
 * cheapest provider in the ladder is also the one that keeps the most at home.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 *   Never report a message as sent unless the thread can be seen to contain it.
 *
 * A telephony layer that silently no-ops is worse than one that fails: the
 * negotiation loop above will happily wait for a reply to a message that was
 * never delivered, then record an outcome for a conversation that did not
 * happen. Google Voice is a live web app whose DOM is not a stable contract, so
 * "I clicked something" is not evidence. Every send therefore reads the thread
 * back and confirms its own text arrived, and throws if it did not.
 *
 * The same discipline as the rest of the estate: a 403 is an answer, silence is
 * not, and you do not get to claim you spoke because you moved your mouth.
