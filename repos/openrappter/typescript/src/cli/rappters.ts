/**
 * See and create the rappters running on this device. — #107
 *
 * A device runs an alpha plus any number of hatched twins, and after #101/#102/
 * #103 that works. Nothing could answer "what is running right now" — every
 * twin started during development had to be stopped with `kill <pid>` against a
 * number captured by hand at launch.
 *
 * The one place that looked like a roster lied. `~/.openrappter/instances/`
 * held two names while zero twins were running, one of which had never
 * successfully started at all, because SQLite leaves the lock FILE behind when
 * it releases the lock. So nothing here treats a directory as evidence of life.
