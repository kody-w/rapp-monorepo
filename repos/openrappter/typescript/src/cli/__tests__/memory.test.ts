/**
 * `openrappter memory` has to reach the memory the product keeps.
 *
 * The module was complete and never registered, so the command fell through to
 * the `[message]` positional and was sent to the model as a chat prompt. It was
 * left unregistered on purpose: it built a `MemoryManager`, which holds
 * everything in `Map`s and performs no file I/O, so `add` printed an id and
 * discarded it on exit. Registering that would have been worse than the command
 * not existing. #204
 *
 * The product's memory is `MemoryAgent`'s, in `~/.openrappter/memory.json`.
 * What matters is therefore not that the command runs, but that what it writes
 * is still there afterwards — so this asserts a round trip through a scratch
 * home, which the previous implementation could not have passed.
