/**
 * `getIMessageServiceStatus()` used to report three things that were each
 * individually defensible and collectively false.
 *
 * Observed on the machine that motivated this, all at the same moment:
 *
 *   launchctl print gui/501/com.openrappter.gateway  -> exit 0
 *                                                       state = not running
 *                                                       last exit code = (never exited)
 *   ~/.openrappter/gateway.pid                       -> 44229
 *   lsof -nP -iTCP:18790 -sTCP:LISTEN                -> node 44229
 *
 * Status therefore said loaded=true (exit 0 means *registered*, not running)
 * and live=true ready=true (the port answered — from pid 44229, a process the
 * installed agent does not own). Nothing was lying on its own; the composite
 * told an operator the service was healthy when the job they installed was not
 * executing at all.
