/**
 * A device runs an alpha rappter plus any number of hatched twins. — #94
 *
 * The runtime lock was one file per home directory:
 *
 *   join(homedir(), '.openrappter', 'gateway.pid')
 *
 * No port, no instance in the path, and `index.ts` called `acquireLock()` with
 * no arguments — so exactly ONE rappter could run per machine. Measured before
 * this change: a daemon started on a *different port* still died on the lock.
 * The lock was never per-port; it was per-device.
 *
 * That is incompatible with the architecture this product is for, where an
 * alpha and its twins meet as peers over /twin and /chat and none of them can
 * tell what kind of peer answered.
 *
 * It also produced a failure nobody could read. `com.openrappter.gateway`
 * started seven times and exited 1 every time — not an orphan, not a stale job,
 * just a second instance being refused — and three separate diagnoses of that
 * were wrong before the singleton was found to be the cause.
 *
 * The two properties under test: the alpha's path does not move, and two
 * instances can hold locks at once.
