/**
 * The dormant CLI command modules stay dormant.
 *
 * `src/cli/index.ts` re-exports fifteen `register*Command` functions. Only nine
 * are ever invoked by `src/index.ts`; the other six declare fully written
 * commands against dependencies nothing wires — the CLI twin of the dormant
 * `gateway/methods/*.ts` modules that `dormant-methods-stay-dormant.test.ts`
 * pins.
 *
 * The trap here is specific to Commander. The root command declares
 * `.argument('[message]', ...)`, so an *unregistered* command does not error —
 * the token is read as a chat prompt and the process exits 0. `openrappter
 * send hello` looks like it ran; it reached the model. So "the file exists and
 * is exported" tells you nothing about whether the command is reachable, and
 * "it exited 0" tells you nothing about whether it did what it said.
 *
 * Each of the six is dormant for a measured reason, not an oversight. Verified
 * against the running gateway and the OAuth flow, not by reading:
 *
 *  - registerChannelCommand  — `openrappter channel` IS live, but as an inline
 *    command in index.ts (release-channel status/switch/promote), and this
 *    module is a duplicate of it. Wiring it double-registers `channel`.
 *  - registerChannelsCommand — sends `{channel}`; `channels.connect` /
 *    `channels.disconnect` read `params.type`, so both would pass `undefined`
 *    to the registry.
 *  - registerSendCommand     — sends `{channel, message, target}`;
 *    `channels.send` reads `{channelId, conversationId, content}`, and `--all`
 *    calls `channels.broadcast`, which the gateway never registers.
 *  - registerSessionsCommand — calls `sessions.list/get/delete`, none of which
 *    the gateway registers (the real ones are `chat.list/session/messages/
 *    delete`); `sessions.reset` is registered but reads `sessionKey`, not the
 *    `{id}` this sends, so even that throws "sessionKey required".
 *  - registerLoginCommand    — `initiateOAuthFlow` persists nothing, yet the
 *    command prints "Credentials have been saved to your config." Same lie the
 *    memory CLI would tell (#204).
 *  - registerMemoryCommand   — `MemoryManager` holds chunks in in-memory `Map`s
 *    with zero file I/O, so every CLI process starts empty. Filed as #204.
 *
 * This asserts the source of truth — which functions `index.ts` actually calls.
 * The neighbouring `cli-registration.test.ts` asks the built CLI which command
 * *names* it exposes; together they cover both "the module is wired" and "the
 * command is reachable". If any of the six starts being invoked here, someone
 * wired a command that lies.
