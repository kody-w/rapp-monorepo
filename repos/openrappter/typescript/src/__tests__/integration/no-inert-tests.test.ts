 * No test file may be added that cannot fail.

 * A test that imports no product code and reads no real artifact is asserting
 * literals against themselves. It passes whatever the product does, and it
 * still reports as a passing test, so the suite total overstates what is
 * actually covered.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical here. `parity/security.test.ts` used to be one of
 * these. Inverting `ApprovalManager.checkApproval` so that a tool *not* on the
 * allowlist becomes `allowed: true` — a real privilege escalation — left that
 * suite at 20 passed. The rewrite in #210 catches it with 4 failures. #213
 * then rewrote or removed eight more.
 *
 * Rewriting the rest is worth doing, but on its own it fixes only the
 * instances. This guard closes the class: `KNOWN_INERT` may shrink and may
 * never grow, so the remaining debt is visible and no new inert file can be
 * added without deliberately editing this list.
 *
 * Being listed here is not an accusation that a file is worthless — some are
 * specifications with no product unit yet to point at. It means the file
 * cannot currently fail, and should not be counted as coverage.
