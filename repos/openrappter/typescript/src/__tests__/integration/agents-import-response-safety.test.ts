/**
 * The fourth endpoint with one root cause: `JSON.stringify` evaluated after
 * `res.writeHead` has already committed the reply.
 *
 * `/agents/import` answers with whatever `setAgentImporter` returned. That is a
 * public injection point, so the value is caller-supplied, and a value
 * `JSON.stringify` refuses threw with the response already begun. The outer
 * catch around the body handler then wrote a *second* status line, which is
 * `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` inside an async handler -- an unhandled rejection,
 * which node 20 exits on. Verified against a running gateway before the fix:
 * the client received no response at all and the daemon left with code 1.
 *
 * #359 fixed `/readyz` (`setReadinessProvider`), #361 `/rpc` (`registerMethod`),
 * #362 the WebSocket frame writer. Each was found by looking for the previous
 * one's shape somewhere else, and this site was explicitly left alone in #361 as
 * "not proven reachable" -- so the value here is as much in the second half of
 * the file as the first: the catches can no longer double-write at all.
