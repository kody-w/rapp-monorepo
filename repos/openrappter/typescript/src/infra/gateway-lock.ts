 * hatched twins, exactly as a brainstem hatches twins, and they meet as peers

 * started seven times and exited 1 every time — not an orphan, not a stale job,
 * just a second instance being refused by the singleton — and three separate
 * diagnoses of that were wrong before the cause was found.
 *
 * The ALPHA keeps the original path byte for byte, so nothing already installed
 * moves or has to be migrated. Every other instance is keyed by its explicit id
 * when it has one, and otherwise by the port it listens on — which is already
 * unique per instance on a machine, because two servers cannot share it.

/**
 * The one name a rappter is known by, everywhere.

 * different ports (19884 and 19291) and shared a single lock directory,
 * endpoint record and roster row. Live consequence:
 *
 *   $ openrappter hatch "a b"   -> Hatching a b on :19884 (pid 85246)
 *   $ openrappter hatch "a_b"   -> a_b is already running on :19884 (pid 85246)
 *
 * The second reported success about a DIFFERENT twin. `a_b` was never started.
 *
 * That is #101 again — the lock and the port disagreeing about which rappter a
 * process is — surviving in the same module the fix put them in, because one
 * side hashed the raw string and the other the cleaned one. Both now go through
 * here, so there is nothing left to drift. #111
 *
 * Anything reaching a filesystem path from user input is flattened, so an id
 * like `../../alpha` cannot walk out of the instances directory and seize the
 * alpha's lock. Replacing separators is not sufficient on its own: an id of
 * exactly `..` survives that untouched and resolves the join straight back to
 * ~/.openrappter/gateway.pid — the alpha's file. So a key that is only dots is
 * rejected outright. Caught by its own test.
 *
 * A name that is ALREADY canonical maps to itself unchanged, which is what
 * keeps every existing twin on the port it has today.
