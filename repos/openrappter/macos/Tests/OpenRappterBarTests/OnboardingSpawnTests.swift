/// Onboarding must not die on a spawn that could never have worked.
///
/// The defect this covers: the GitHub auth step ran `dist/index.js` as a process
/// executable. That file is mode 0644 with no shebang — an ESM module, not a
/// program — so `Process.run()` threw `NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4`, which
/// Foundation renders as `The file "index.js" doesn't exist.` The file was on
/// disk the entire time.
///
/// Two things are asserted here, because fixing only the first would leave the
/// trap armed for the next caller:
///
///  1. The spawn now succeeds, because the script is run through `node`.
///  2. When a spawn *does* fail this way, the error says what is actually
///     wrong instead of repeating Foundation's untrue message.
/// Foundation localises with typographic quotes; compare on a flattened form.
