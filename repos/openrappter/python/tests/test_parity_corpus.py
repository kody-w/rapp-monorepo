"""The parity corpus is a gate, not a one-off report.

PARITY §5/§6 mark both the golden corpus and the harness PLANNED, so nothing in
the estate executes them. openrappter declares tier `core` in SPEC.md; this test
is what turns that from an assertion into something CI re-checks on every
change.

Running the corpus the first time found six normative divergences, including a
5-round tool loop where §2.2 freezes 3 and calls looping 5 times non-conformant
by name.

        `message` in preference to `user_input`, so it sent the model different
        text than typescript and the grail and every vector still passed.

        `history-carried-to-model` is a sixteenth. Every one of the fifteen
        reached the model with an EMPTY history -- the only vector carrying a
        `conversation_history` is `history-role-filter`, which is rejected 400
        before the model is called. So the corpus could not see a runtime that
        dropped or reordered a valid transcript, and the harness's
        `outbound_history_roles` assertion was declared by no vector at all.
        Arming it found python forwarding only `user` and `assistant` while
        validating the wider `_HISTORY_ROLES`, so a `tool` turn was accepted,
