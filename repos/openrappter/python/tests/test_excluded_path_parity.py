"""Both runtimes must exclude the same credential-bearing files.

Exclusion is not about hiding the path -- a path is not a secret. When a
recorded object carries a file locator for an excluded path, *every* sibling
field in that object is replaced with ``[excluded-path]``, including
``content``. So a credential file missing from the list means its **contents**
are written to the flight log.

Measured before this test existed, ``.netrc``, ``.npmrc``, ``.pypirc``,
``.pgpass``, ``.htpasswd``, ``.docker/config.json``, ``.kube/config``,
``.gnupg`` and the ``.pfx``/``.jks`` siblings of the already-excluded ``.p12``
were all absent. Value-pattern matching rescued some contents by luck, but an
``.npmrc`` auth token and a ``.pgpass`` line reached the log verbatim.

``must_keep`` matters as much: a false positive here blanks a whole record, not
one field.
