"""The brainstem's HTTP entry point, tested on malformed framing.

`do_POST` began with

    length = int(self.headers.get("Content-Length") or 0)
    raw = self.rfile.read(length) if length else b""

Three things follow from those two lines, all reproduced against the running
server with a raw socket before anything was changed:

    Content-Length: abc          no HTTP response at all -- ValueError left
                                 do_POST unhandled and the connection closed
    Content-Length: -5           no HTTP response
    Content-Length: 2000000000   blocked forever waiting for bytes that were
    (19 bytes sent)              never sent

The TypeScript gateway answers the first two `400 Bad Request` and always
answers something, so the target behaviour here is not invented -- the same
three headers were sent to both runtimes and this file encodes what the other
one already did.

`ThreadingHTTPServer` gives each request its own thread, so the third case did
not wedge the server; it leaked one thread per request instead, which is a
slower version of the same thing on a daemon meant to run for weeks.
