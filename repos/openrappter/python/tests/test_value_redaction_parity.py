"""Both runtimes' flight recorders must redact the same values.

`SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS` exists in two places -- here and in
`typescript/src/flight-recorder/redaction.ts` -- and they had drifted. Measured
before this test existed, TypeScript redacted four things Python passed through
verbatim:

    ?key=AIzaSy...        the shipped Gemini provider builds this URL
    xoxb-...              Slack bot token
    sk-...                OpenAI / Anthropic key
    eyJ........           JWT

All four in the same direction, and none the other way, which is what makes it
drift rather than a deliberately smaller redactor.

The corpus lives in `contracts/value-redaction-corpus.json` and is read by both
this file and its TypeScript counterpart, so a pattern added to one list cannot
silently miss the other. `must_keep` matters as much as `must_redact`: a ledger
that blanks ordinary values keeps the record and loses the ability to read it.
