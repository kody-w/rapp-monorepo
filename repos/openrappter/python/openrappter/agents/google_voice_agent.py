"""Google Voice watch decisions, on the grail bones.

This is the Python half of `typescript/src/telephony/watch.ts`. The two are
deliberately transliterations of each other and are held together by a shared
fixture, `tests/google-voice-parity.json`, which both sides assert against.

WHY THE DECISIONS ARE SHARED BUT THE TRANSPORT IS NOT
-----------------------------------------------------
openrappter can drive Chrome over the DevTools Protocol, so on a laptop the
Google Voice rung really can send and receive. A grail brainstem running under
Pyodide or Azure Functions has no browser, no subprocess, and no socket to give
it one — so on those tiers the rung simply is not available, and this agent says
so rather than pretending.

What must NOT differ is the judgement. If the same inbox produces a reply on one
platform and silence on the other, then "the twin runs on both bones" is not
true, and which machine happened to wake up first becomes a behavioural fact.
So every rule below is byte-identical in intent to the TypeScript, and the
parity fixture fails loudly if the two ever drift.

ARTICLE VII
-----------
Nothing here imports anything outside the standard library, touches the network,
reads a clock, or shells out. `now` is always a parameter. That is what makes
the file portable to every tier, and it is enforced by an AST test rather than
by good intentions.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
----------------------------------
An always-on agent that can send texts fails dangerously in one direction only:
replying to things it should not, at machine speed, to real people. First run
against years of history. Answering its own outbound. Two bots ping-ponging.
Re-answering the same message every poll because state was lost. Every rule is
one of those, and the default answer is NO.
