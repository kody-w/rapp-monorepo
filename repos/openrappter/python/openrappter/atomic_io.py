"""Durable JSON writes, and honest handling of a file that did not survive.

``Path.write_text`` opens with ``O_TRUNC``: the previous contents are gone the
instant the call begins, and the new bytes are only in the page cache when it
returns. A crash, a kill, or a full disk in that window leaves a file that is
empty or half-written, and the old value is unrecoverable.

That is not theoretical. Killing a process during ``write_text`` and polling
the target's size, the file was observed at zero length and left unparseable
in 5 of 5 attempts. The same test against the temp-file-and-rename strategy
below left either the complete old value or the complete new one, 5 of 5 --
never anything in between.

``os.replace`` is atomic on POSIX and on Windows, so a reader either sees the
old file or the new one. Renaming into place is the whole point: the risky
part happens on a file nobody is reading, and the visible file changes in one
indivisible step.

Several modules here already do this correctly by hand -- ``brainstem``,
``show_and_tell``, ``imessage.config``, ``imessage.state``, ``pokemon_agent``.
This module exists so the next one does not have to reinvent it, and so the
two registry clients that were still calling ``write_text`` can share a single
implementation.

    Returns ``default`` when the file is missing, unreadable as JSON, or holds
    something other than an object. Callers must pass a freshly built default
    each time, because the value is handed back for the caller to mutate.

    A damaged file is renamed rather than ignored. Ignoring it reads the same
    as "nothing is installed", and the next save then overwrites the only
    evidence of what was there. Renaming keeps the bytes next to the file they
    came from, so the state is recoverable by hand and visible to anyone
    wondering why the tool suddenly forgot something.

    ``object_fields`` names keys the caller is going to index into, and so
    cannot cope with holding anything but an object. Checking only that the
    *file* is an object stopped one level short of what every caller needed:
    both registry clients read a lock and immediately evaluate
    ``lock["installed"]``, which measured as ``KeyError`` for ``{}``,
    ``TypeError`` for ``{"installed": null}``, and -- worst of the three --
    a quiet wrong answer for ``{"installed": "alice/tool-and-then-some"}``,
    where ``in`` is a substring test that reports an agent as installed that
    was never installed.

    A missing key and a wrong-typed one are not the same failure and are not
    treated the same. Missing means nothing was ever written there, so it is
    filled in from ``default``: no evidence exists to destroy, and quarantining
    would punish a file that is merely older than the key. Present-but-wrong
    means something did write a value, so the file is moved aside under the
    same rule as any other damage rather than being silently reinterpreted.
