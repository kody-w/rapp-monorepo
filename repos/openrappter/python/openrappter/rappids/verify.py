"""Proof, not assertion.

Mirrors ``typescript/src/rappids/verify.ts``.

Every claim an organism makes about itself is re-derived here from bytes on
disk: the manifest hash over canonical JSON, the identity seed over the
traits, the identity motif over the RAPPID, each asset's exact length and
digest, and the body-frame chain. A creature that says it weighs three
megabytes and cannot produce them is not heavy, it is wrong -- and the
difference has to be visible in the report rather than smoothed over.

Nothing here is a heuristic and nothing is estimated. A check either passes
with the evidence that made it pass, or fails with what did not match.
