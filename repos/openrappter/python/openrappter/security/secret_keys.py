"""One answer to "is this field name a secret?".

The TypeScript runtime had two, and each missed what the other caught, so
`apiKey`, `privateKey`, `signingKey` and `sessionKey` were written into the
structured log in the clear. That was fixed in openrappter#76.

This body had the same logging pattern, character for character:

    token|password|secret|credential|authorization

so it leaked the same five names. Fixing one runtime and leaving the other is
how the two stop meaning the same thing.

Matching is on word boundaries rather than substrings, so `apiKey` and
`private_key` are caught while `monkey` and `keyword` are not — blanking a
field named `keyCount` would cost the debuggability the log exists for.

Kept deliberately in step with typescript/src/security/secret-keys.ts; a test
asserts the two agree on a shared table of names.
