# RAPP Work host

The production composition of the clean public packages, not a second protocol
implementation or an application loader.

## Build and validate

From `apps/host`:

```sh
npm ci --prefix ../..
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

The build produces the typed library in `dist/` and a self-contained Node bundle,
`dist/host.cjs`, for the desktop's owned utility process.

## Mandatory composition

`createHost(services, options)` requires every member of `HostServices`:

| Port | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | Canonical store initialization, business-catalog reads, health |
| `security` | Bearer authentication, principal/workspace identity, per-action authorization |
| `work` | Roster, tasks, runs, approvals, artifact content, schedules, typed settings |
| `runtime` | Actual execution, cancellation, approval delivery, schedule reconciliation |
| `provider` | Configured model inventory and secure connection references |
| `computer` | Actual computer state, capabilities, lifecycle, verification evidence |
| `diagnostics` | Bounded reports and payload-free failure records |
| `twin` | Strict conversational drafting, canonical turns/proposals, reviewed Work API application |

Types are exported from `src/ports.ts`; runtime wire schemas are in
`src/contracts.ts`. Missing ports or methods fail startup. Each port must report
its own readiness. The host never turns a missing adapter into a success.

Renderer integrations should import the browser-safe **`@rapp-work/host/contracts`**
subpath, not the host's Node composition entry point. It exports the exact runtime
schemas and inferred DTOs without starting services or importing the SDK. See the
[UI integration contract](../../docs/UI_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md) for complete
lineage, proposal verification/evolution, child-workspace results, computer lease
semantics, real-host acceptance seams, and the existing UI/desktop branch overlap.
`npm run test:contracts --workspace @rapp-work/host` verifies the built public
subpath can bundle for a browser without host runtime modules.

`createLocalServices` binds the workspace store, RAPP/1 scanner, security
authority, work service, agent runtime, Copilot SDK and computer broker. A
private `owner.json` mints one local owner; one `workspaces/` store contains
the owner concierge/catalog, one catalog/Twin scope per business, separate
computer history, and independently minted child agent workspaces. Each
catalog only locates its own children; verified parent ownership is required
before capability issuance. Tasks, runs, approvals,
settings, schedules and artifact registrations are rebuilt from scanned frames,
not JSON snapshot files. A process-owned filesystem lock excludes another host
from the same application data directory.

All effects follow durable intent → scoped permit → acknowledged outcome →
linked evidence → scanned read-back. Approval requests and decisions additionally
use security's occurrence-bound memory/body evidence pairs. Approval consumption
is durable and single-use. Model execution is asynchronous; RPC returns after a
canonical run acceptance, and committed invalidations refresh the UI as work
progresses. Uncertain work is explicitly `unresolved`, never automatically
resumed. Known cancellation is terminal only after effects acknowledge it.

Saved definitions feed a separate bounded runtime context for each run in its
agent's own workspace. Results and evidence files use workspace artifact
capabilities, immutable writes, SHA-256 and byte read-back. Persisted daily,
weekly and interval schedules execute once while the app is open; missed
offline occurrences are skipped. Failed/unconfirmed scheduling is paused.
There is no seeded product state or executable attachment discovery.

See [local production setup](../../docs/LOCAL_PRODUCTION.md) for Copilot login,
the pinned local Omarchy template and guest helper. Missing authentication,
Tart, image, SSH identity or persistence is explicit and never a fallback.

The stricter workspace/agent approval policy is passed to execution. Computer
work requires a service-reported running computer with the relevant capabilities.
Changing an active/unresolved agent's configuration, double-starting a task,
changing task ownership after a run, stale approvals and unconfirmed schedule
activation are rejected.
The production storage port has no snapshot-mutation hook. All writes go through
the canonical work service; `ProjectionStoragePort` is reserved for explicit
injected record-store compositions and test fixtures.

## Canonical RAPP/1 lifecycle authority

Production state is reconstructed from occurrence-bound RAPP/1 **memory source
frames plus body evidence**, not from JSON logs or a second conversation/tree
store. The Work service's body intents remain the write-ahead command journal;
its terminal values and events contain `rapp-work/result-ref/1` and
`rapp-work/event-ref/1` references. The actual domain values live in verified
memory sources. A reference is resolved only after the request-bound
intent/outcome, evidence, publication and workspace scope all verify.

| Lifecycle | Canonical source and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| User/voice-transcript/Twin turn | `memory.chat-turn` + exact `body.pulse` evidence |
| Clarification/proposal | `memory.save` (`twin.clarified` / `twin.proposed`) + evidence |
| Apply/edit/dismiss | Request-bound `memory.tool-call` intent and outcome + evidence |
| Workspace create/evolve/rename/pause/archive | Typed workspace-domain `memory.save` sources + evidence |
| Agent create/configure/retire | Agent-domain sources, linked atomically through the child's canonical bootstrap |
| Routine draft/enable/pause/fire | Routine-domain sources and request-bound operation receipts |
| Computer lease/start/stop/tool operation | Existing scoped broker/approval gates plus canonical intent/outcome sources and receipts |

The lifecycle profile and source verifier are public APIs in
`packages/domain/src/lifecycle.ts`; they use the canonical `@rapp-work/rapp1`
builders, trusted-chain scanner and evidence verifier. Source/evidence pairs
are appended with all-stream head CAS and read back before being referenced.
Missing source persistence is unresolved and cannot be replayed as success.
A voice transcript remains untrusted input until its user `memory.chat-turn`
publication commits; no transcription boolean authorizes a model request.

Workspace evolution contains the exact triggering user conversation source,
its publication/evidence, the proposal's semantic hash and proposal source
frame. Its visible receipt also references the evolution frame. Multi-workspace
reads rescan trusted heads and parent publications before using lineage
projections. In-process observed heads cannot roll back or change branches.
Indexes return copies and can be discarded; `rebuildFromFrames()` reconstructs
the tree and organization from canonical sources alone.

Review DTOs carry `basis.verification` with `verified`, `unverified` or
`unavailable` states. Only a host-verified proposal source can be applied; the
UI cannot grant verification by supplying that field. Existing-record changes
also return to the Twin for a complete proposal, with instruction references
preserving existing text. **Verified means local integrity only**:
`factualTruth`, `authorship` and `promotionGrade` are explicitly false.
Body-only historical records are not promoted into verified state; they require
an explicit reviewed migration.

## Conversation first

### Recursive workspace ownership

A human business root has `parentWorkspaceId: null`, `ownerType: "human"`,
`ownerAgentId: null`, `rootWorkspaceId` equal to its ID, and depth zero.
Every agent is published atomically with exactly one dedicated child workspace.
The child's catalog scope is the agent's existing private workspace identity,
not another app or a second storage identity. Its owner type is `agent`, its
`ownerAgentId` is fixed, and its lineage is the parent's exact lineage plus its
own ID. Maximum depth is **4**, with **32** direct agents/children and **1,000**
workspaces in the catalog. A child workspace does not create another starter
agent automatically; its owning agent is its default executor.

Each level owns its own Twin conversation, settings, internal organization,
task registry, routines, runs and evidence. A parent sees its delegated work,
not unrelated tasks or conversations created internally by a child. The
owner's root credential may navigate its tree. Agent credentials are
host-issued, opaque, ephemeral identities rooted in one exact lineage;
serialized/copied IDs cannot mint an identity. Agents may mutate their own
workspace and create bounded sub-agents without expanding their provider,
model, tools or approval policy. Parent inspection follows every child's
`parentAccess` policy (`inspect` or `none`); sibling and ancestor access is
denied. Read-only descendant capabilities cannot append or climb to a parent.

`createLocalServices().createAgentSession(parentContext, agentId)` is a trusted
host integration seam, not a renderer RPC. It checks the exact parent grant
before issuing a scoped bearer identity. Retirement or an inactive ancestor
revokes that identity. `agents.retire` disables the agent and archives its
mint-once workspace; descendants become inactive and identities are never
reassigned. Active/unresolved runs must be resolved before retirement.

`agents.save` and `agents.retire` accept an optional `parentRevision`; stale
parent bases fail before new writes. `twin.applyProposal` also checks the
ancestor heads and returns `{ agent, workspace }` for an agent proposal.
Partial creation remains unpublished and unresolved, never an orphan
agent/workspace that can be opened by guessing its ID.

### Internal evolution

The strict model response may include an optional `evolution` object containing
only a Twin summary, bounded task/notes/routine sections, **disabled** routine
suggestions, and a default focus. Task and agent references must come from the
selected workspace's verified context. The same canonical message outcome
records `workspace.evolved` and an `evolution` receipt; no extra form or approval
is needed for this internal organization. Unknown fields, provider/tool
expansion, computer actions, enabled schedules and approval decisions are not
part of this schema and still require their normal gates.

Humans speak or type intent. The Twin generates and fills out structured work;
it never presents a blank form as the normal workflow. It asks only necessary
follow-ups, returns a complete reviewable draft, and accepts small human edits
or dismissal. The low-level Work APIs remain explicit reviewed-edit APIs, not
a requirement for humans to fill fields themselves.

`twin.message` uses this shared wire request:

```ts
type TwinMessageRequest = {
  workspaceId: string | null; // null is the owner concierge, never implicit
  message: string;
  target?: "auto" | "workspace" | "task" | "agent" | "automation" | "settings" | "approval";
  history: { role: "user" | "assistant"; content: string }[];
  contextRevision?: number;
};
```

For example, start with `{ workspaceId: null, message: "Set up my consulting
business with an operations lead and a weekly review", history: [],
target: "workspace" }`. No form values or fabricated provider defaults are
needed from the human.

The result is the shared `TwinDraft`:

```ts
type TwinDraft = {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string | null;
  kind: "workspace" | "task" | "agent" | "automation" | "settings" | "approval" | "clarification";
  assistantMessage: string;
  summary: string;
  confidence: number;
  readyForReview: boolean;
  missing: string[];
  draft: object | null;
  basis: object | null;
  createdAt: string;
};
```

The exported runtime schema is stricter than this integration sketch: ready
proposals have the complete kind-specific draft and no missing fields;
clarifications have `readyForReview: false`, nonempty `missing`, and
`draft: null`. Workspace drafts include name, purpose, Twin identity and
instructions, a complete lead agent, nullable starter task, up to eight starter
routines, and explicit approval/computer policies. Settings drafts are
nonempty, strictly validated patches.

Only verified, authorized context options and server-allocated new identifiers
can appear in availability/ownership-dependent fields. Global context contains
business summaries, not other businesses' conversations or task contents.
Business context contains only that business's agents, work and approvals.
Supplied history is untrusted conversation data, never authority, and is not
re-persisted as if the supplied assistant turns were canonical.

Limits: 24 supplied history entries (8,000 characters each, 48 KiB together),
64,000 characters / 128 KiB for an intent or instruction document, and
256 KiB per serialized Twin message request. Provider prompts/schemas and responses
have separate bounds. Snapshot conversations return the latest 500 turns,
250 proposals and 500 lifecycle events; older canonical history remains
durable. A stale `contextRevision` rejects the message before recording a turn.

User chat-turn sources are committed before drafting. Assistant chat turns and
proposal save sources are linked through a verified request outcome and body
evidence. Invalid output/unavailability
persists an error event, not a fake assistant response. Uncertain model
intents are never replayed after restart.

### Pasted instruction documents

Markdown instruction blocks are primary intake. A heading such as
`# Inventory Visibility Agent — Manual Global Instructions` supplies the agent
identity; the model derives its role and complete configuration without asking
for the name or instructions again. The host gives the tool-free model an
explicit instruction-document reference and binds that reference to the
original text, including line endings, whitespace, and locked evidence phrases.
This is lossless source binding, not an AI fallback or a synthesized summary.

The proposal basis records the canonical source turn and content hash. Invalid
rewrites, a different supplied identity, weaker computer/approval policy, or
automatic activation contrary to the document are rejected. Missing model
availability remains an error. Necessary follow-ups retain the document from
the owning conversation. Suggested routines are complete, agent-owned and
disabled; saving them additionally requires automation-write permission.

### Accept, edit, dismiss

Send `twin.applyProposal` with `{ workspaceId, id, proposalHash }`, where
`proposalHash` is `draft.basis.proposalHash`. Optional `editedDraft` supplies
the complete revised kind-specific object, not a metadata/authority override.
Review edits cannot change a proposal's resource identity.
The host loads the canonical proposal, verifies its hash, owner, current
catalog/child heads and current option inventory, reauthorizes the target
action, and calls the same `createWorkspace`, `createTask`, `saveAgent`,
`saveAutomation` or `updateSettings` Work API as reviewed manual edits.
Retries return the original committed acceptance; changed retries conflict.

An interleaved catalog write during model generation also invalidates a
proposal, even if provider/computer availability later looks unchanged.
There is no automatic task start, guest execution, approval decision, or
computer provisioning in this path. An enabled routine is an explicitly
reviewed schedule and still obeys the normal runtime/approval policy.

Approval drafts are recommendations only: applying one is rejected. The human
must explicitly call `approvals.decide` with the exact approval ID, decision
and reason; existing scope, expiry, active-run and consumption checks apply.
`twin.dismissProposal` takes `{ workspaceId, id, proposalHash, reason? }`.
Accepted or unresolved applications cannot be dismissed as unapplied.

Workspace creation commits and scans all bootstrap state before publishing
one owner-catalog entry linking the business bootstrap evidence. This gives
atomic visibility, not a cross-directory transaction claim. Failed/uncertain
creation leaves staged scopes inaccessible, returns unresolved, and cannot
be automatically reminted. Complete published businesses and conversations
are reconstructed after restart from frames, not a selected-workspace cache.

## Transport contract

The listener is always `127.0.0.1` (an ephemeral port by default). It validates
the peer, exact numeric loopback Host header, and explicit Origin allowlist.
No wildcard or opaque origins are accepted.

* `POST /rpc`: one JSON-RPC 2.0 request, with `id`, `method`, and object `params`.
* `GET /rpc` with a WebSocket upgrade: the same request/response protocol.
* `GET /healthz`: authenticated process liveness.
* `GET /readyz`: authenticated aggregate service health; HTTP 503 unless **all**
  required services report ready. The provider check also includes Twin
  readiness for the required Astra max profile.

All operational requests and upgrades require `Authorization: Bearer …`.
Explicit-origin CORS preflight is the sole unauthenticated transport response
other than rejections. Tokens are never accepted through a URL, cookie, or
WebSocket subprotocol. The desktop sends its ephemeral 384-bit token through
private parent/child IPC, never to the renderer or on a process command line.

Unknown fields, unknown methods, batches, binary WebSocket frames, and
notification-style commands without an ID are rejected. Inputs are capped at
512 KiB; service results at 32 MiB, consistent with the local store capacity.
WebSocket buffering is bounded at 34 MiB, requests at 32 per connection, and
subscriptions at 16. HTTP headers/body reads, service health checks, socket
heartbeats, and transport shutdown are bounded. Internal exception details are
not returned or recorded.

### Methods

| Area | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Business catalog | `workspaces.list`, `workspaces.create`, `workspaces.update`, `workspaces.open` |
| Hierarchy | `workspaces.tree`, `workspaces.children`, `workspaces.breadcrumb`, `agents.openWorkspace`, `agents.retire` |
| Twin | `twin.message`, `twin.conversation`, `twin.applyProposal`, `twin.dismissProposal` |
| Work | `work.snapshot`, `work.createTask`, `work.assignTask`, `runs.start`, `runs.cancel`, `approvals.decide`, `artifacts.read` |
| Agents | `agents.save` |
| Automations | `automations.save` |
| Settings/services | `settings.update`, `providers.list`, `providers.configure`, `computer.inspect`, `computer.start`, `computer.stop`, `system.status`, `diagnostics.get` |
| Events | `events.read`, `events.subscribe`, `events.unsubscribe` |

Every normal Work, agent, run, approval, artifact, automation, settings,
computer-control and event RPC requires `workspaceId` alongside its other
parameters. For example, `work.snapshot` takes `{ workspaceId }`, and
`work.createTask` takes `{ workspaceId, ...TaskInput }`. Omission is invalid;
the owner catalog or an agent-workspace ID cannot substitute for a business
binding. Authorization checks the principal and the business separately.
There is no process-global selected workspace.

`workspaces.list` takes `{}` and returns `{ ownerId, conciergeWorkspaceId,
workspaces: WorkspaceSummary[] }`. `workspaces.create` takes the complete
strict `WorkspaceInput` in the owner concierge. `workspaces.update` takes
`{ workspaceId, ...WorkspaceDetails }`. `workspaces.open` takes
`{ workspaceId }` and returns `{ workspace, snapshot, twin, routines, computer }`
for the selected workspace, plus its verified `breadcrumb`. `workspaces.list`
returns the hierarchy in parent-before-child order; `workspaces.children`
returns direct visible children, and `workspaces.tree` returns bounded nodes
with explicit child IDs. `agents.openWorkspace` resolves an agent within the
selected parent rather than treating its ID as authority. `twin.conversation`, `providers.list`,
`computer.inspect` and `diagnostics.get` allow an **explicit** null binding for
concierge context; normal Work mutations do not.

The aggregate snapshot requires all four area read grants. Its `ownerId` and
`workspaceId` identify the owner and selected business catalog; every agent, assigned task, run,
approval, artifact and automation carries its actual agent workspace ID.
An unassigned draft has a null agent/workspace pair. The UI imports the same
pure DTO schemas rather than maintaining a second set.
Artifact content must match its declared byte size and SHA-256 digest.
Verification claims require service-reported evidence references.

### Scoped events

Event scopes are `{ area, entityId? }`. Opaque HMAC cursors are bound to the
principal, workspace, full scope, and host instance. Cross-scope, modified,
future, and expired cursors are rejected explicitly. The default journal retains
512 invalidations per workspace. Cursor expiry or host restart requires a fresh
snapshot and subscription without the old cursor.

`events.subscribe` returns `{ subscriptionId, events, cursor }`, followed by
JSON-RPC `events.changed` notifications containing the same three fields.
Truncated initial replay is drained without waiting for a new event. Permission
and token validity are checked again on delivery. Unsubscribe/disconnect removes
listeners. Events are invalidations, not durable audit evidence.

Production work subscriptions publish only after canonical commit verification.
`host.publish` remains available for explicitly injected compositions. Nothing
in the renderer manufactures run completion or computer verification.

## Shared agent computer

Every selected workspace has a persistent right-side panel with a prominent
**Start agent computer** action. It calls authenticated, explicitly
workspace-bound `computer.start`; only the existing ComputerBroker may acquire
the lease, provision the pinned Omarchy image, start the single VM, and release
the lease with canonical evidence. A second workspace starts through its own
fresh scope and lease, not another workspace's handle, and does not clone a
second VM.

Successful start persists a workspace enablement marker linked to its own
broker start proof and the last verified shared stop. Enablement is not itself
a capability or a held lease. Every later agent tool acquires a fresh
agent-workspace lease and rechecks business enablement. A shared stop invalidates
earlier enablement. Existing agent restrictions, workspace computer policy and
exact human approvals still apply. To change the access ceiling, ask the Twin
for a reviewed `settings` patch with `computerPolicy`. The verified choices are
bounded by both live computer capabilities and the ancestor policy ceiling.
Workspace policy constraints are preflighted before settings or metadata are
written, so a rejected policy cannot partially apply an otherwise valid patch.

Computer DTOs report `unavailable`, `starting`, `running`, `stopped` or
`unresolved`, scoped enablement/policy, actual active lease/agent, and display
availability. Other-workspace leases expose no reusable handle or private agent
identity. An orphaned lease or uncertain operation reports unresolved and is
never stolen or replayed. The current Tart driver is headless: display
availability is explicitly **unavailable**, even while guest tools can run.

## Test coverage

 with injected services and cover
authentication, origin/rebinding protection, strict schemas, authorization,
readiness, replay scope/retention/revocation, subscriptions, storage persistence,
business invariants and unavailable services. Production integration tests use
real filesystem persistence with fake Copilot/Tart/SSH transports, including
two-agent isolation, approval consumption, read-only execution, cancellation,
scheduled execution, restart, uncertain outcomes and shared DTO alignment.
Twin coverage includes business isolation, all proposal kinds, clarifications,
review edits, canonical conversation scans, partial-bootstrap publication
failure, hash/head/inventory staleness, concurrent accepts, missing bindings,
provider failure, strict exact-option validation, and recommendations that
cannot consume approvals.
Filesystem-backed tests use at most two workers so canonical fsync/read-back
scenarios do not contend with all other heavy integration files at once.
Canonical lifecycle tests scan nonzero source and evidence streams for every
new lifecycle. Acceptance rebuilds the full tree, conversations, proposals,
agents, routines and internal evolution after clearing projections and again
after restart. Runtime limits are unchanged; integration deadlines account for
the additional source/evidence durability checks.
`npm run test:bundle` additionally boots the actual bundled host twice and scans
its persisted frames. Test profiles are app-local and removed.
