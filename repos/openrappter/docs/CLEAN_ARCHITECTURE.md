Protocol code imports no application, provider, agent, gateway, or VM code.
Applications receive mandatory dependencies at the composition root. There are
no optional production adapters whose absence leaves a branded but non-working
surface.

## Ownership

- A **Principal** is the authenticated local human or trusted host component.
- The owner's **ConciergeWorkspace** owns the catalog of businesses and global
  workspace-creation conversations. It is not a default work execution scope.
- A **BusinessWorkspace** has one canonical catalog scope, one Twin identity,
  explicit purpose/policies, and independent child agent workspaces. Its ID
  equals its catalog workspace ID, not an agent workspace ID.
- An **Agent** is a persistent worker definition and policy.
- An **AgentWorkspace** is the agent's sole durable state owner.
- It is also that agent's dedicated recursive workspace: the same Twin,
  conversation, work, routines, evidence and computer panel. Each workspace
  records a mint-once owner, parent, root, lineage and depth. Roots are human
  owned; children are agent owned. Depth is capped at four and direct agents at
  32, without automatically creating another starter agent at each level.
- A **Task** belongs to one agent and one workspace.
- A **Run** is one execution attempt for a task.
- The **Computer** is one shared host-owned Omarchy VM with its own canonical
  body history. Agent tool streams reference computer receipts.

Caller-supplied IDs locate resources; they never grant authority. Every service
receives a scoped capability created after authorization.
Business parent ownership is recovered from verified catalog/bootstrap and
agent-registration commands, never inferred from a supplied resource ID.
Normal Work RPCs require an explicit authorized workspace binding. Agent
identities are host-issued and lineage-bound; copying IDs or principal fields
does not create authority. Sibling and ancestor access is denied, while parent
inspection must satisfy every child's policy. Retirement archives the owning
workspace and makes its descendant lineage inactive without reassigning it.

## Conversation and review

The human expresses intent, not a set of blank form values. The Twin receives
bounded conversation and verified workspace options, asks only necessary
follow-ups, and generates complete strict drafts. The model transport uses a
fresh tool-free Copilot SDK session with GPT-6 Astra, max reasoning and
`long_context`, without a model/provider fallback.

User/assistant turns, proposals, acceptances and dismissals are canonical
Work commands in the owning catalog. Global creation conversations remain in
the concierge. A model output is untrusted until its discriminant, complete
draft and every availability-dependent choice pass validation.
Their authority is the mapped RAPP/1 memory source and linked body evidence,
not a body log containing a parallel JSON copy. User/Twin turns use
`memory.chat-turn`; proposals and domain transitions use `memory.save`;
request-bound apply/dismiss/edit and operation intents/outcomes use
`memory.tool-call`. Work outcomes contain source references. Source scans,
publication proofs and exact lineage are required before projection.
Optional internal evolution can update only a bounded Twin summary, sections,
disabled routine suggestions and default focus. Its canonical receipt belongs
to the same conversation and workspace. External effects, active schedules,
provider/tool expansion, approval decisions and computer actions remain gated.
Evolution also binds the exact triggering chat source/publication and proposal
frame/semantic hashes. Review sheets require a verified proposal projection;
verification means integrity-only with factual truth, authorship and
promotion-grade trust explicitly false.

Review binds a proposal hash to canonical heads and verified option inventory.
Acceptance reauthorizes the target action and calls the same Work APIs as an
explicit human edit. An interleaved write during drafting, changed child
heads, or changed availability invalidates the basis. Approval recommendations
cannot decide; the exact human `approvals.decide` command remains necessary.

Workspace creation stages and verifies the business catalog, Twin identity,
lead definition and optional starter work/routines, then publishes one
verified owner-catalog entry. This is atomic **publication**, not a claim of a
cross-directory filesystem transaction. Failure before publication leaves
inaccessible staged scopes and an unresolved intent. A private durable
reservation binds each child agent ID to its first workspace and parent
lineage before minting, so restart may recover that exact staged child but
never remint or reparent it. Catalog refreshes build detached verified maps,
validate that every source stayed at the scanned version, and install the maps
only as one serialized update; invalid refreshes revoke publication rather
than retaining uncertain authorization.

## Canonical transition

1. Resolve principal, agent, workspace, task, and current trusted heads.
2. Authorize the exact command and affected resources.
3. Append and read back one canonical write-ahead intent.
4. Execute once inside the Omarchy guest under a scoped permit.
5. Append terminal outcome and linked evidence.
6. Read back and scan the committed chains.
7. Publish the projection/event only after verification.

If outcome persistence is uncertain, the run becomes `unresolved`; it is never
automatically replayed.

## Host boundary

The host may execute only fixed application-owned commands needed to manage
Tart and its SSH transport. Agent tools cannot invoke host shell commands. All
business execution happens in the guest. The guest receives mediated workspace
access rather than arbitrary host mounts.

## Storage

Each agent workspace contains:

```text
identity.json
manifest.json
frames/body/
frames/memory/
frames/swarm/
artifacts/
imports/
```

Tasks, approvals, schedules, runs, and memories are projections from frames.
SQLite may index projections and diagnostics, but is never the canonical event
authority.

## Migration

Migration is a separate executable mode:

1. discover known legacy paths without loading code;
2. inventory records and produce a review plan;
3. copy selected data to `imports/`;
4. append canonical import frames with source hashes and timestamps;
5. verify the new workspace;
6. archive but do not delete the source automatically.

Normal startup does not probe legacy homes.

## Release boundary

Production supports macOS Apple Silicon only. The release gate verifies:

- exact clean source commit and lockfiles;
- complete packaged module allowlist;
- absence of removed legacy modules and assets;
- RAPP/1 authority and fixture hashes;
- signed application, hardened runtime, notarization, and stapling;
- DMG checksum and provenance;
- safe replacement and rollback.

Unsigned local builds are clearly marked development builds and are never
published as production.
