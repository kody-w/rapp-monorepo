// rapp-drill — the application that uses the method.
//
// qqdrill.mjs implements finding work another machine already did and absorbing
// what is safe to absorb. Until now nothing called it: a reviewed, tested
// library shipped as dead code. This is what makes it usable.
//
// Everything is plain files a person can read with `cat`:
//
//   <root>/line.jsonl              the local line, one RAPP/1 frame per line
//   <root>/checkpoints/<utc>.jsonl a copy of the line taken BEFORE each fold
//   <root>/journal.jsonl           what happened, one event per line
//
// No database, nothing that needs a daemon, nothing that has to be running for
// the files to mean something. If this application disappears, the record it
// leaves is still readable.
//
// The two rules it exists to keep:
//   scan changes nothing — it is safe to run constantly
//   fold checkpoints first — there is no un-merge, so there must be a way back
