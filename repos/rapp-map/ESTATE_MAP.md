# Historical estate observation

[`estate-map.json`](estate-map.json) records a 92-repository observation with
source timestamp `2026-06-28T20:21:23Z`. Its repository claims, liveness
results, role assignments, and recommendations are historical observations.
They have not been refreshed or authenticated as RAPP/1 registry state.
The retained payload is sourced from baseline commit
`baded0098d8b97c2876c0b8af4475cf3061b7ad0`.

The payload is retained byte-for-byte in Git history at that commit; the
SHA-256 and non-authoritative disposition of the still-frozen evidence live in
[`HISTORICAL_OBSERVATIONS.json`](HISTORICAL_OBSERVATIONS.json), not under the
unchanged historical schema token. Do not use it for protocol authority, trust
decisions, current existence claims, or owner acceptance. See
[`RAPP1_STATUS.md`](RAPP1_STATUS.md).

The working-tree [`estate-map.json`](estate-map.json) is no longer that
photograph: since 2026-07-25 it is derived output, rebuilt from mechanical
observation by `tools/spine.py` and never hand-edited, so it is deliberately
not byte-pinned. Its integrity is enforced by the spine's drift ratchet rather
than by a frozen digest. See [`SPINE.md`](SPINE.md).
