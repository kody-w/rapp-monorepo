"""DoubleDown — russian-doll prompt amplifier.

Given any topic (use case, domain, idea, project, seed prompt), this agent
returns a directive that drives the brainstem's LLM to emit a numbered list
of god-mode prompts custom-built to extract maximum value from the
distributed swarm-twin pattern (project twins, neighborhood coordination,
autonomous specialization via learn_new_agent).

Russian-doll property: every emitted prompt is itself a paste-ready input
that can be fed back into double_down for the next layer of amplification.
