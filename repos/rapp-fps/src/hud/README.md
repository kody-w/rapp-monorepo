# Combat HUD

`CombatHud` is a reusable DOM presentation subsystem with one
`requestAnimationFrame` writer. It creates its nodes once, consumes public bus
messages or its narrow status methods, and never imports weapon implementation
code. It does not self-register in production; the integration coordinator
must mount it from the boot path.

```ts
const hud = new CombatHud({
  playerId: localPlayer.id,
  profiler: {
    snapshot: () => engine.profiler.snapshot(),
    drawCalls: () => sceneStats.drawCallsPerFrame,
    budgetMs: 16.7,
  },
});
engine.add(hud);
```

`playerId` is required because the shared `Damage` channel carries events for
every character. Events whose `id` does not strictly match the configured
player are ignored without changing health or the directional indicator.

The compact performance overlay is not mounted unless the URL contains the
exact flag `?hudDebug=1`. It reads `gpuFrameMs.p95`, `cpuFrameMs.p95`, and the
paired `budgetFrameMs.p95`; rAF cadence is not treated as render cost.

## Input seams

Existing core events are consumed for damage, reload start/end, and ADS state.
The following local names support the harness and integration without touching
core-owned contracts:

- `weapon:status` — `WeaponHudStatus`
- `player:status` — `PlayerHudStatus`
- `combat:hit-confirm` — `HitConfirmedEvent`
- `combat:elimination` — `EliminationEvent`
- `hud:objective` — `ObjectiveHudStatus`
- `hud:interaction` — `InteractionHudStatus`

Core should publish these names (or canonical replacements) before other
subsystems emit them. Damage `direction` is defined here as the world-space
vector from the damaged player toward the source; core should make that
direction convention explicit when it adopts the payload.

The coordinator still needs to register this subsystem from `src/main.ts`,
provide the local player identity and profiler/draw-call sources, and translate
canonical contracts into these seams. This directory-scoped library and
harness are not, by themselves, a shipped production HUD.

## Evidence harness

Run from the repository root:

```sh
npx vite --config src/hud/vite.harness.config.mjs
node src/hud/tests/run-hud-tests.mjs
node src/hud/evidence/capture.mjs
```

The harness is fixed to port 5332 and exposes `hip`, `ads`, `reload`,
`damaged-left`, `low-health`, `hit-confirm`, and `objective` shot states. It
uses only system fonts and generated CSS geometry. Its
`?mutation=no-reuse` mode is a harness-only negative control that deliberately
appends discarded nodes; no equivalent switch exists in the production API.
