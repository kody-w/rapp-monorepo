/**
 * Public surface of Mission 3 — "Foundry Last Light".
 *
 * The parent integrates by calling `buildFoundry()` in place of `buildArena()`
 * and handing the result to the SHARED `ArenaLevel` (untouched), exactly as
 * `src/main.ts` does for the cargo bay. `createFoundryLevel` packages that so
 * the boot path is a one-liner and the second player slot / final objective are
 * available alongside the level, the static world and the definition.
 *
 * Nothing here edits a shared file: it composes the existing level subsystem
 * around a new, contract-compatible definition.

 *
 * `containerDressing` defaults to `false`, and an **explicit `undefined`** from a
 * caller is coalesced to `false` too: the Foundry authors no `container`-material
 * solids, so the shared cargo-dressing layer has nothing to build (and its merge
 * step throws on an empty selection). Only an explicit `true`/`false` from the
 * caller is honoured; passing `{ containerDressing: undefined }` cannot re-open
 * the throwing default-on path. A caller may still turn dressing on deliberately.
