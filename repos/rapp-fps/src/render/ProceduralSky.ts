/**
 * A procedurally generated environment. No image asset, no downloaded HDRI —
 * every value here comes out of a shader, which is the whole point: metals with
 * nothing to reflect read as plastic, and the fix a critic actually sees is an
 * environment the surfaces are standing *in*.
 *
 * What this produces, once, at boot:
 *
 *  - a crisp cubemap of a graded dusk sky with a single warm sun, used as the
 *    scene background so the frame is a place rather than a black void; and
 *  - a PMREM prefilter of that same cubemap, used as `scene.environment` so
 *    every MeshStandardMaterial gets image-based lighting — real specular
 *    reflections on the metals, real ambient on everything else.
 *
 * Both come from ONE render of the sky, so the reflection in a chrome sphere and
 * the sky behind it are the same sky. The sun direction is handed in so it can
 * be aligned with the scene key light: the highlight a viewer sees on the metal
 * then agrees with the shadow the key light casts, which is the kind of quiet
 * coherence whose absence reads as "CG" without anyone being able to say why.
 *
 * The bake is one-time. At runtime this adds zero fullscreen passes, but the
 * materials do sample the environment texture. Three current trials measured
 * 6.5ms default versus 6.3ms with IBL disabled while holding the sky constant,
 * inside the harness's ~0.9ms run-to-run range. The cost is below the current
 * instrument's resolution, not proven zero.
