Public catalog of RAPP **rapplications** — bundled directories that pair a single-file agent with a UI, a service, or a state cartridge. Drop them into your local brainstem and they work — or browse them like Pokémon via the [Pokédex API](#pokédex-api).

> **Rapplications are organisms.** Per the unification ratified in `kody-w/RAPP` (vault note: *Rapplications Are Organisms*), every entry in this catalog is a digital organism that has graduated — passed review, earned skin (a UI bundle), suitable for hosting inside someone else's brainstem. Distributed via this catalog as both a bare singleton `.py` and a portable `.egg` cartridge ([brainstem-egg/2.2-rapplication schema](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP/blob/main/rapp_brainstem/utils/bond.py)).

> **Looking for bare agents?** A single `*_agent.py` with no UI belongs in **[kody-w/RAR](https://github.com/kody-w/RAR)** — single-celled organisms without skin. Per [Constitution Article XXVII](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md), bundle goes here, bare goes there.

This repo was extracted from [`kody-w/RAPP`](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP) on 2026-04-26 as the content layer of the platform. The engine (Tier 1 brainstem, Tier 2 swarm, Tier 3 worker) lives in `kody-w/RAPP`. Trust metadata (signing, identity, provenance) lives in the RAR registry. This repo is just **content** — rapplications you can fetch and run.

## Gated rapplications (private substance, public discovery)

Most catalog entries are public — anyone can fetch the source with a normal `curl`. But some rapplications **shouldn't be world-fetchable**: an operator's internal control plane, engine IP distributed inside an org, customer-specific bundles built on top of an open base. For those, the catalog supports **gated rapplications** — a public catalog entry whose source files live in a **private** GitHub repo.

The catalog publishes the rapp's existence, shape, and metadata. GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` returns HTTP 404 for unauthenticated callers and HTTP 200 only for callers with read access on the private repo. Public discovery, private substance.

```jsonc
// in index.json's rapplications[]:
{
  "id": "cockpit",
  "manifest_name": "@wildhaven/cockpit",
  "access": "private",
  "private_repo": "kody-w/RAPP_Store_Private",
  "singleton_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store_Private/main/apps/@wildhaven/cockpit/singleton/cockpit_agent.py",
  "singleton_sha256": "c77195ef…",
  "auth_hint": "gh auth token  →  curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" <singleton_url>"
}
```

```bash
# Anyone can verify the gate is real:
curl -sSL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store_Private/main/apps/@wildhaven/cockpit/singleton/cockpit_agent.py
# → 404 (anonymous)

# With a PAT scoped for read on the private repo:
curl -sSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gh auth token)" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store_Private/main/apps/@wildhaven/cockpit/singleton/cockpit_agent.py
# → 200
```

The full contract — manifest fields, validator behavior, installer responsibilities, security boundaries — lives in [**SPEC §11**](./SPEC.md#11-gated-rapplications-access-private). The design rationale is in [Proposal 0005](./docs/proposals/0005-gated-rapplications.md).

This is **federation Mode C** in the submission-paths taxonomy (see [SPEC §7](./SPEC.md#7-submission-paths)) — federation referencing a private repo, with the gate being GitHub's own access control. No servers, no relays, no custom auth code; the PAT is the access token.

## Pokédex API

Modeled on [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) — the catalog is a tree of static JSON files served from `raw.githubusercontent.com`. No backend, no auth, no rate limits, no infra to operate. Push to `main` → the API "deploys."

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store/main/api/v1/index.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store/main/api/v1/rapplication/<id>.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store/main/api/v1/sprite/<id>.svg
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store/main/api/v1/egg/<id>.egg
```

Each `<id>.json` is a Pokédex entry: id, name, rappid, types, stats (`has_skin`, `singleton_lines`, `singleton_bytes`, `singleton_sha256`), parent rappid (lineage walks back to the species root), URLs to the egg + sprite + singleton + UI bundle. Each `<id>.svg` is a deterministic 6×6 sprite generated from the rappid hash. Each `<id>.egg` is a brainstem-egg/2.2-rapplication cartridge — drop into a brainstem and the rapp installs.

The [`rapp-zoo`](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-zoo) consumes this API in its **Discover** tab — sprites + cards + one-click egg downloads. Drag the egg back onto any brainstem to hatch the rapp.

Rebuild: `python3 scripts/build_pokedex_api.py` (walks `apps/@*/`, regenerates `api/v1/` atomically — JSON entries, sprites, eggs).

## Legacy catalog

[`index.json`](./index.json) at the repo root remains the original catalog (`schema: "rapp-store/1.0"`) consumed by the brainstem's binder service. Same source data as the Pokédex API; both are generated from the per-app `manifest.json` files.

## RAPP Zoo v2 prototype summons

The additive [Zoo v2 Store extension](./specs/RAPP_ZOO_STORE_V2.md) provides a
static prototype-summon data plane without changing the v1 catalog or Pokédex.
`api/v2/discovery.json` is a small mutable pointer whose only target is an
immutable generation document at a full 40-character commit-pinned GitHub Raw
URL. Prototype artifacts and MIT license evidence are also commit-pinned and
SHA-256 verified.

Store v2 writes are serialized through one restartable issue branch at a time.
Every attempt derives content/predecessor-bound generation, branch, and tag
names. An atomic create-only remote lock ref, carrying workflow/issue/attempt
owner metadata, is the repository-wide authority; Actions concurrency only
coalesces contention and is not a queue. Exact-owner lease cleanup runs in
`finally`, while crashes leave an explicit lock requiring audited admin-only
recovery after the owner run and PR are proven inactive. Every generation
commit receives an annotated
`zoo-v2-generation-*` permanent tag before discovery can point at it. Required
current-main validation checks both the predecessor URL and exact digest, and
the scheduled audit proves tag and raw reachability independent of the PR
merge method. An active repository ruleset prevents generation-tag updates and
deletion. Every PR's changed paths are checked by trusted-main code; protected
Store changes are limited to authorized same-repository release/bootstrap
branches. The complete local three-dot Git diff is used instead of the
3,000-file-limited PR-files API. The required status is bound to a dedicated
validator GitHub App by exact context plus App ID; its protected environment
holds the App ID, slug, bot login/database ID, and private key. The App is
narrowly limited to commit-status write, issue write, pull-request write/read,
and contents read. Only its installation token may write Zoo lifecycle
markers, labels, issue closure, or stale-PR retirement; default Actions tokens
and `github-actions[bot]` comments are untrusted. The generation-tag ruleset is dedicated and has no bypass
actors. Administrator branch/ruleset configuration is out-of-band, with a
committed audit required before release. See the extension spec for App
permissions, environment protection, configuration, and bootstrap order.
Immediately before a tag is published, release re-fetches and revalidates
`main`, then uses an atomic main lease with the tag push. A stale retained
attempt is verified and permanently archived; a rerun derives a different
attempt from the new predecessor rather than moving or deleting a tag.
Label, manual, and scheduled reconciliation fully paginate the bounded open
eligible issue set, repair add-only PR/processed markers, and select the oldest
unprocessed command without relying on a trigger issue number. Scheduled runs
therefore drain coalesced or dropped issue notifications in order; incomplete
API scans and contradictory markers fail closed.

Create, update, and deprecate commands arrive as structured, inert GitHub
Issue JSON. An actor allowlist and deterministic validator turn an eligible
issue into a tested two-commit catalog PR; nothing auto-merges. Live records
are explicitly `prototype`, use the exact `RAPP/1` wire term and `rappid`
identity form, preserve external blockers, and set ecosystem acceptance to
`not-asserted`.

## Layout

Each rapplication is a directory with at least:

- `manifest.json` — metadata that the catalog generator reads
- `singleton/<name>_agent.py` — the converged single-file agent
- `source/` — pre-collapse component agents (optional, for reference)
- `ui/index.html` — optional iframe UI
- `eggs/*.egg` — optional state snapshots
- `README.md` — what the rapp does and how to use it

## Submitting a rapplication

The catalog accepts any single-file agent that satisfies the SPEC §5 contract in `kody-w/RAPP/pages/docs/SPEC.md`:

- one file
- one class extending `BasicAgent`
- one `metadata` dict (OpenAI function-calling schema)
- one `perform(**kwargs) -> str`

Open a PR with your rapplication directory + a regenerated `index.json` entry. There is no review gate beyond the contract — RAR (the trust layer) provides identity attestation separately, but the catalog itself never refuses a contract-conformant agent.
