# Changelog

## 0.1.1 - 2026-09-18

- Added protocol-neutral `hive-hub-chant/1` with deterministic seven-word
  locators derived from a complete `dial:sha256:` Dial Record ID.
- Corrected the public sample chant while preserving the original 0.1.0 source
  URLs, release object, schemas, and device-local dialbook compatibility.
- Added a versioned `hive-hub-dialbook/2` profile that separates aliases from
  chants and cryptographically binds locator and declaration references.

  `hive-hub` CLI.

- Added inert protocol learning, adapter registration, join cards,
  plan/apply/revert subscriptions, and one-card bootstrap.

  writes, clean JSON errors, and zero-network tests.
- Integrated six exact-fingerprint stdlib adapters through a lazy, optional
  core bridge and plan-first CLI registration.
- Added the locked universal Agent Skill with exact core camera-AI card support
  and repository-neutral verified join-contract detection.
