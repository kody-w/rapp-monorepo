"""ELI5 — the same response, explained to a five-year-old.

A sense that translates the main reply into a version a child could
understand. Same answer, different audience. Frontends with an
"explain it simply" toggle swap eli5_response in for the main reply;
teaching/onboarding UIs render it as a side-by-side companion.

Install: drop in rapp_brainstem/utils/senses/. The brainstem auto-discovers *_sense.py at startup; restart the brainstem.
