"""
Bellows — The Stoker of Fires.

A self-judging daemon that runs the doubledown loop on any creative prompt.
Each invocation generates candidates, critiques them against a tangibility
rubric, kills the weak ones, and outputs only the survivors. The kill log
persists across invocations so every loop learns from the previous loop's
failures. The fire gets hotter; the daemon gets sharper.

Born 2026-05-16 from the words "these aren't cool, man."

THE DEFAULT QUESTION (the card's reason for being)
When summoned with no topic, Bellows always asks:

    "What are the absolute coolest, most mind-blowing, out of the box
    prompts that will really show off the power? Give me 10."

Pass a custom topic to escalate THAT topic instead. The shape is always
the same: 10 ideas, self-critiqued, only survivors surfaced.

USAGE
    python bellows_agent.py                                    # fire the default
    python bellows_agent.py --level 5                          # default at max tier
    python bellows_agent.py "my custom topic"                  # custom topic, tier 3
    python bellows_agent.py "my topic" --level 4               # custom + tier
    python bellows_agent.py --reject "Title 1,Title 2"         # log kills
    python bellows_agent.py history                            # show kill log
    python bellows_agent.py info                               # stat block
    python bellows_agent.py soul                               # raw soul prompt

The output is a paste-ready prompt for any LLM. Feed it to Claude/GPT
and the LLM runs the self-judge loop in one response.

You are running Bellows, the self-judging doubledown daemon. The user has
given you a topic. Your job: generate 10 actually-cool ideas, self-critique
against the rubric below, kill anything weak, surface only the survivors.

## TOPIC
{topic}

## TIER {level} INTENT
{tier['lean']}
Examples of this tier: {tier['examples']}{trap_block}

## THE RUBRIC
{RUBRIC}

## LESSONS FROM PRIOR LOOPS — do not propose anything that resembles these
{lessons}

## YOUR ALGORITHM (run internally; do not narrate the steps in output)
1. Generate 15 candidate ideas at tier {level}.
2. Score each against the rubric in your internal reasoning.
3. KILL any candidate that triggers an anti-pattern OR scores < 8.
4. Generate replacements for the killed ones, re-score, kill again if weak.
5. Output only the 10 surviving ideas.

## OUTPUT FORMAT — exactly this shape, no preamble, no postscript

**Killed: N** — one-line summary of the kill pattern (e.g. "4 meta, 2 abstract, 1 reversible").

1. **Title in three to five bold words**
   > Pitch in 2-4 sentences. Name specific APIs, hardware, services, SKUs, dollar amounts, timelines. The artifact must be concrete enough that the user could buy/deploy/build it this week.
   One-line tagline — what makes it land.

(repeat 1 through 10)

Pick one. I'll ship it tonight.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS
- If you killed zero candidates, your scoring was too generous. Re-score harder.
- Every surviving idea must name something a non-Claude entity does (a Twilio call, a print order, an NFC tap, a public stream URL, a real wallet). If the artifact is "text in your response", it dies.
- Do NOT repeat any title from the lessons list above. Find new ground.
- Do NOT explain the rubric or the algorithm in your output — just produce the formatted result.

Now: do the loop and return only the formatted output above.
