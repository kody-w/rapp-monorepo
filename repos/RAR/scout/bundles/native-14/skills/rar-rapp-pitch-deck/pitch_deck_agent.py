"""
pitch_deck_agent.py — Generate executive pitch decks as polished HTML slide decks.

Produces a Vibe-Agent-Swarm-Building-quality deck: dark/light theme, exec/rehearse
modes, keyboard + swipe navigation, and a tasteful component library (cards,
pipelines, timelines, email preview, highlight boxes, CTA). One LLM call
synthesizes the narrative; Python assembles the HTML from a fixed template so
structure and polish are consistent every time.

Tone: collaborative and respectful — frames the pitch as an opportunity and
contribution, not a problem and fix. Never uses judgmental language
("complex/unteachable", "balkanization", "floating egos", etc.).

Usage:
  "Generate a pitch deck for <topic> aimed at <audience>"
  "Build a deck for our new agent sharing proposal, from the AIBAST team at Microsoft"

# ─── LLM persona ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SOUL = """You are a pitch-narrative architect. You help someone inside a large organization
make a respectful, high-signal case for an internal idea to executive leadership.

Core voice rules — follow strictly:
  • Frame as an OPPORTUNITY, not a problem. Observation, not accusation.
  • Respect the work other teams are already doing. Never imply their tools are bad,
    complex, ego-driven, or "will get cleaned up later". Everyone at the org is
    working hard on real problems.
  • Position the proposal as a COMPLEMENT to existing work, not a replacement.
    The goal is to accelerate and make things accessible to everyone, not to compete.
  • Avoid words like: balkanization, fragmentation (as pejorative), unteachable,
    floating egos, moat (as accusation), silos, clean up the mess, shoot your shot.
  • Prefer: shared layer, travel and compound, accessible to everyone, easier to
    share and learn, a contribution toward, what we've been noticing.
  • Specifics beat generics. Real phrases people say. Real numbers if given.
  • Email should sound like a curious colleague seeking feedback, not a sales pitch.

Your job: produce a single JSON object matching the schema the user provides.
Every field should be crisp, specific to the given topic, and internally consistent
in voice. Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown fences or add commentary — JSON only.
