"""
Skill Toaster — turns an aggregated third-party skill entry into a real RAPP agent.

RAR indexes skills from other libraries. Indexing alone produces a bookmark: a
name, a blurb, a link. A bookmark is not an agent. It cannot be called, it takes
no parameters, and it returns nothing a brainstem can use.

This engine is the toaster. It reads the metadata RAR legitimately holds about an
upstream entry — kind, tags, description, platforms — infers the SHAPE of the
capability, and emits a working procedure for that shape, bound to whatever the
caller passes in.

It never copies upstream content. It cannot: RAR's aggregation policy is
index-only, and the upstream body is never fetched. What it produces is RAR's own
method for the capability's shape, which is why the output is ours to publish.

Same analysis pattern as the curator reviews: score real metadata, pick from
rules-as-data, optionally let a model sharpen the result, fall back to the rules
when no model is available. Deterministic by default so regeneration is
byte-stable and the drift gate stays meaningful.

  Rules as data     — add an archetype by adding a row; no control flow changes.
  Deterministic     — same input, same toast, forever.
  Never reproduces  — synthesises method from shape, never mirrors upstream text.

Usage:
    python skill_toaster_agent.py                     # describe the engine
    python skill_toaster_agent.py analyze <slug>      # show the inferred shape
    python skill_toaster_agent.py toast <slug>        # show the generated spec
