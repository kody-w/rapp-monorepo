## Microsoft Scout runtime

This is the reversible Scout projection of `@cowork-cookbook/roi_and_value_selling_artifact`. The original RAPP
agent is preserved byte-for-byte in `roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py` and in the RCI capsule.

When Scout can execute local files, resolve this skill directory and run:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_agent.py --preflight
echo '{}' | python3 scripts/run_agent.py
```

Pass the real JSON arguments instead of `{}`. The runner verifies the linked
agent SHA-256 before importing it. If preflight reports a host dependency that
Scout cannot satisfy, use the `brainstem_chat` MCP tool to run the canonical
agent in the user's Brainstem. Never paraphrase the factory or agent into a new
implementation. The generic direct-file commands in the generated Toaster
section are recovery guidance; Scout should prefer the verified runner.

ROI and value selling artifact — Builds an executive business value story for a named customer and product — strategic context, 9 use cases, 2x2 prioritization, pain→outcome map, KPIs, transparent ROI model, and call to action — as a 5-7 slide deck and

AGGREGATED ENTRY. The content authority for this capability is the upstream
library; this file is the structured RAR container for it. It carries a
manifest, a version locked to upstream, a content hash, a provenance record and
a public feedback thread — none of which the upstream entry has on its own.

This entry carries the upstream recipe itself, under its licence and with
attribution: the prompt verbatim, the prerequisites, the step-by-step and
the expected output. Toasting made it deterministic — the same call returns
the same recipe every time — and callable from any Brainstem. The upstream
library remains the authority for the recipe and links home for the source.

  Source library : Cowork Cookbook (Sean Galliher and Cowork Cookbook contributors)
  Upstream entry : https://coworkcookbook.com/recipes/roi-and-value-selling-artifact

  Upstream version: 1.0.0

Regenerated automatically by scripts/generate_aggregated_agents.py whenever the
upstream record changes, so this file and its source cannot silently diverge.

## Run this — do not improvise

This capability's deterministic implementation is a RAPP single-file agent, linked beside this file as `roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py` and embedded as the fenced Python below (sha256 9de1fc3f83470e45…; a byte-exact copy is also vaulted in the capsule comment at the end of this file). On a host with sandbox execution, run the linked file directly — if it is missing, write the fence contents verbatim to `roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py` first:

```bash
python3 roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py '{"key": "value"}'      # arguments as one JSON object
echo '{"key": "value"}' | python3 roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py   # or on stdin
python3 roi_and_value_selling_artifact_agent.py --tool                      # emit the JSON tool contract
```

Treat stdout as a tool result. If it reports missing or unresolved inputs, stop and collect them. If it returns `steps`, execute those steps in order exactly as returned; if it returns `instructions`, follow them with the supplied inputs. Otherwise use the result verbatim. Do not invent behavior beyond that output. On a host without code execution, treat the Parameters schema and the code below as the exact specification and never paraphrase a step. Never edit inside the generated markers; a converter-equipped host can instead restore the original file checksum-verified with the installed `rapp-agent-converter/scripts/toast.py convert SKILL.md --to agent`.
