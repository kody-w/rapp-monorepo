# Field requirements — and where RAR stands against each

This document exists so nobody has to take a claim on trust. Every row below
records a requirement raised in enterprise review, an honest status, and a way
to check the answer yourself — a URL you can open, a command you can run, or a
test you can read.

Requirements are paraphrased as capability statements. No individual is quoted
or named, and nothing internal is reproduced here.

**Status vocabulary**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Solved** | Shipped, verifiable today by the evidence in the row. |
| **Partly solved** | Real mechanism exists; a named gap remains. |
| **Out of scope** | A real problem, but organisational rather than technical. RAR cannot fix it and does not pretend to. |

## 1. Consumption — "business users do not live in GitHub"

The single most important requirement: an end user must never be sent to a
repository. The consuming application owns the experience.

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1.1 | Consume the registry without a GitHub account, login, or repo UI | **Solved** | Every endpoint is anonymous static JSON. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/manifest.json` — no token, no headers. |
| 1.2 | Embed the catalog inside a host application (AIdeate, vBrainstem, grail brainstem) | **Solved** | `api/v1/catalog.json` — one fetch returns all 278 agents with descriptions, tags, tiers and provenance. No second request, no SDK. |
| 1.3 | Call it from a browser without a proxy | **Solved** | GitHub raw and jsDelivr both return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Verify: `curl -sI .../manifest.json \| grep -i access-control`. |
| 1.4 | No backend to run, fund, or operate | **Solved** | There is no server. Every endpoint is a file committed to `main` and served by GitHub's CDN. |
| 1.5 | Pin to a known-good version | **Solved** | Swap `main` for a commit SHA in any URL, or use `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kody-w/RAR@<sha>/...`. |
| 1.6 | Prove a real user journey needs no GitHub at all | **Solved** | **[discover.html](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/discover.html)** — describe a problem in plain English, get ranked agents. Automated test loads it with `github.com` blocked at the network layer; it completes with zero errors because it only ever reads two static files. No account, no repo chrome, no publisher handles. |

**Read `manifest.json` first** — it lists every endpoint and includes copy-paste
recipes for rendering a catalog, recommending from a use case, and installing an
agent. For the experience itself, open
**[discover.html](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/discover.html)**.

## 2. Discovery — "do not show them everything"

Exposing a raw catalog was explicitly rejected. Discovery has to start from the
user's own words.

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 2.1 | User describes a use case, a recommendation comes back | **Solved** | `api/v1/match.json` ships 20 canonical use cases plus a 2,226-term ranking index. Matching runs client-side; no model call, no backend. |
| 2.2 | Free-text queries, not just fixed categories | **Solved** | `match.json.index` maps term → `agent_id:weight`. Tokenize, sum, sort. The algorithm is written out in `how_to_query`. |
| 2.3 | Ranked results, not an unordered dump | **Solved** | Weighted by field (name and tags ×3, category ×2, description ×1) and damped by document frequency so common words cannot dominate. |
| 2.4 | Relevance good enough to trust | **Solved** | "review vendor contracts for risk" → *Vendor Contract Risk Review* first. "supply chain has supplier delays" → *Supplier Risk Monitoring* first. "sales team keeps missing forecast" → *Deal Health Score*, *Pipeline Velocity*, *Revenue Forecast*. Reproduce with the snippet in § "Try it", or use [discover.html](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/discover.html). |
| 2.5 | Show why something matched, not just that it did | **Solved** | Ranking retains the matched terms; `discover.html` renders them on every result ("Matched on **review**, **contracts**, **risk**, **renewal**"). |
| 2.6 | One destination, not several competing libraries | **Partly solved** | `manifest.json` is a single discovery root, and `state/federation.json` consolidates peer catalogs. Genuine consolidation is an organisational decision, not a schema one. |

---

## 3. Curation — "we will find novelty content in there"

A catalog that mixes contract analysis with trading-card agents loses an
enterprise audience on first impression.

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 3.1 | An enterprise-safe slice that needs no further filtering | **Solved** | `api/v1/audience/business.json` — 275 agents, novelty excluded. Serve it directly; `discover.html` does exactly that. |
| 3.2 | Novelty must not leak in through a mislabelled category | **Solved** | An explicit novelty tag (`game`, `pokemon`, `collectible`, `adventure`, …) forces the consumer slice regardless of category. A text adventure filed under `devtools` still does not reach the business slice. Tags are normalised, so `trading-card`, `trading-cards` and `Trading Card` are all caught. See `classify()` and `norm_tag()` in `scripts/build_static_api.py`. |
| 3.3 | Curation demonstrably holds | **Solved** | Query the business slice for *"I want to play a game"* — it returns essentially nothing. The games are in the catalog; they are not in the enterprise surface. |
| 3.4 | Curation must not silently hide useful agents | **Solved** | `both` is the default for ambiguous cases and appears in every slice — 170 of 278 agents are in both, so segmentation filters the extremes rather than partitioning the catalog. Misclassification degrades to over-showing, never to hiding. `tests/test_audience_segmentation.py` asserts this in both directions. |
| 3.5 | Quality signal per agent | **Partly solved** | `quality_tier` (`frontier` → `community` → `verified` → `official`) ships on every record and renders on each card. Promotion beyond automated validation is still a human review step. |
| 3.6 | Segmentation visible in RAR itself, not only in the API | **Solved** | `index.html` has an Everything / For work / Personal mode bar backed by `api/v1/audience/map.json` (~14KB). The choice persists, and `index.html?mode=business` deep-links a host application straight into the work view. |
| 3.7 | Segmentation must not become a way to break the page | **Solved** | The mode bar is hidden until the audience map loads and no filtering happens without it, so a blocked fetch or an offline `file://` open renders exactly what it did before modes existed. An agent absent from the map is treated as `both`. Verified in a headless browser with the map blocked at the network layer. |

## 4. Trust and provenance — "where did this come from"

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 4.1 | Every recommendation traceable to a source | **Solved** | Each record carries `source.path`, `source.raw`, `source.cdn` and `source.sha256`. |
| 4.2 | Verify what you downloaded is what was published | **Solved** | `sha256sum` the fetched file against `source.sha256`. |
| 4.3 | Published URLs must not break | **Solved** | CONSTITUTION.md Article XXIII freezes every published path permanently. Enforced by `scripts/check_url_stability.py`, gated in CI ahead of every other job, and covered by `tests/test_url_stability.py` — which proves the gate *fails* on rename and on deletion, not merely that it passes when nothing is wrong. Currently 320/320 paths resolve. |
| 4.4 | Content stays fresh | **Solved** | `build-registry.yml` rebuilds the registry and the API on every push to `agents/**`, so the catalog cannot drift from the files. |
| 4.5 | Detect change without re-downloading everything | **Solved** | `api/v1/status.json` publishes a content hash per endpoint. Compare, then fetch only what moved. |
| 4.6 | Responsible-AI review and formal ALM sign-off | **Out of scope** | An approval process, not a code change. RAR supplies the audit surface (immutable paths, hashes, receipts, CI history); it cannot grant the approval. |
| 4.7 | Aggregating other libraries must not launder their work | **Solved** | Aggregation is index-only: `scripts/crawl_sources.py` records metadata and links, and never fetches or mirrors an upstream body. Every aggregated container carries `source.upstream_url`, `source.upstream_author`, `source.license` and a `content_digest`, and its `describe` operation prints the source. Pinned by `tests/test_skill_toaster.py::test_agent_still_credits_upstream` across all 76 entries. |

---

## 5. Deployability

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 5.1 | Installing an agent must be trivial | **Solved** | `GET source.raw`. The response body *is* the agent — one file, no manifest, no archive, no package manager. This is the single-file principle in Article II. |
| 5.2 | Declare configuration up front | **Solved** | `requires_env` lists required environment variables on every record, so a host application can prompt before install rather than failing at runtime. |
| 5.3 | Declare dependencies | **Solved** | `dependencies` lists `@publisher/slug` entries per record. |
| 5.4 | Agents usable as-is, without rework | **Partly solved** | Agents install as-is; connecting them to a customer's own systems still requires configuration. Honest position: RAR removes the packaging and distribution problem, not the integration problem. |
| 5.5 | One-click deploy to Copilot Studio | **Out of scope here** | Blocked upstream by a platform API limitation, tracked outside this repository. |
| 5.6 | An indexed third-party skill must be callable, not just a bookmark | **Solved** | `@kody-w/skill_toaster_agent` infers each upstream capability's shape from its metadata and generates RAR's own method for that shape, so every aggregated entry ships real `operation`/`subject` parameters, a procedure, acceptance checks and a stated deliverable. Output binds to caller input. `tests/test_skill_toaster.py` proves it: the pre-toast shells fail seven of those assertions, the 76 toasted agents pass all 391. |

---

## 6. Scale and operations

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| 6.1 | Catalog growth cannot depend on hand-curation | **Partly solved** | Submission is automated end to end (`process-issues.yml`, `approve-agent.yml`, `build-registry.yml`). Growth is now bounded by contribution, not by maintainer effort. |
| 6.2 | Serving cost must not scale with usage | **Solved** | Static files on a CDN. A thousand consumers cost exactly what one costs. |
| 6.3 | No dedicated operators to keep it running | **Solved** | Nothing to operate — no server, no database, no queue, no secrets in the read path. |
| 6.4 | Cannot depend on specific individuals | **Solved** | Every step is a committed script run by CI: `build_registry.py`, `build_static_api.py`, `check_url_stability.py`. Reproducible by anyone with a checkout. |
| 6.5 | Support organisation for thousands of users | **Out of scope** | A staffing question. Worth noting the read path has no failure mode to support: static files with no auth and no runtime. |
| 6.6 | Attribute usage to business outcomes | **Partly solved** | `state/metrics.json` and `metrics_history.json` track catalog and engagement metrics. Tying downloads to revenue requires host-application telemetry RAR cannot see. |

## What is deliberately not claimed

Overclaiming is how credibility is lost, so these are stated plainly:

- **Integration is not solved.** Agents install in one request. Wiring them to a
  customer's own systems is real work that RAR does not remove.
- **Support and staffing are not solved.** Static hosting removes the operational
  burden of *serving* the registry. It does not create a support organisation.
- **Business-outcome attribution is incomplete.** RAR can report what the catalog
  contains and how it changes. Connecting that to revenue needs telemetry from
  the consuming application.
- **Catalog size is bounded by contribution.** The pipeline is automated, but
  automation does not by itself produce well-documented agents.
