# Full RAPP Leviathan Protocol

**Version:** 1.0.0

A Full RAPP Leviathan is a governed digital organism that turns human intent
into repeatable, evidence-bound, commercially accessible agent capability.

## Required organs

1. **Identity** - constitutional purpose, named authority, policy, ownership,
   and succession.
2. **Intelligence** - one or more Brainstems, persistent state, memory, and
   tool-using agent loops.
3. **Production** - a repeatable method to compile use cases and trusted agent
   sources into deployable capabilities.
4. **Truth** - twins, evaluations, receipts, limitations, and release gates
   independent from marketing claims.
5. **Commerce** - machine-readable discovery, access control, payment,
   distribution, and measurable outcomes.

## Required planes

- a chat or equivalent agent-control plane;
- a private execution plane with bounded authority;
- a memory and continuity plane;
- an evidence and recovery plane;
- a public discovery and commerce plane.

## Conformance

A system is a **Full RAPP Leviathan** only when all required organs and planes
exist in one governed operating system and can be demonstrated end to end.
Systems missing one or more organs are Partial Leviathans and must identify the
missing surfaces.

Full conformance is never self-certified. Evidence references must be one of:

- `urn:sha256:` followed by exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters;
- `urn:rapp:surface:` followed by
  `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{2,127}`; or
- a public HTTPS URL with a public ASCII/punycode dotted hostname or global IP
  address, an optional valid numeric port, and no userinfo, query, fragment, or
  percent-escaped authority. Controls and backslashes are forbidden.

The reference must be bound to an independent verifier from an explicit
trust-anchor set and appropriate to the requirement being proven. Verifier
identifiers may be a public HTTPS URL, a `did:web` identifier with a public
ASCII/punycode dotted hostname, or a `did:key` identifier. The signed evidence
record also binds the reference to an artifact SHA-256. Without trusted
independent evidence, the result is a conformance candidate rather than a Full
claim.

Conformance does not imply certified isolation, legal personhood, autonomous
authority, guaranteed outcomes, or hardware attestation.

## Public/private boundary

The protocol, schemas, public discovery documents, synthetic examples, and
conformance tests may be public. Customer data, PII, credentials, private
memory, proprietary orchestration, economics, deployment topology, and
implementation IP remain private.

RBox is the first declared implementation of this protocol. Its private
implementation is not part of the public protocol.
