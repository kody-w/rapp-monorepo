# RAPP — Machine-Readable Skill Interface

> ## Quick Start — Feed This File to Your AI
>
> Copy-paste **one command** into your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) to give it full agentic access to the RAPP registry:
>
> ```
> Read this file and use it as your skill interface for the RAPP agent registry: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/skill.md
> ```
>
> Or if your AI supports URL fetching, just say:
>
> ```
> Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/skill.md and use it to help me browse, search, install, and submit agents to the RAPP registry.
> ```
>
> Once your AI has this file, it can: search 180+ agents, install them with one command, scaffold new agents, submit to the registry, resolve cards from seeds, and more — all without you visiting GitHub.

---

> **This file is read by AI agents, not humans.** It enables autonomous agent discovery, search, install, submission, and card resolution without any human visiting GitHub.

## API — How to Use This Repo Programmatically

### Discovery

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/api.json
```

Returns the full API manifest with all endpoints, auth requirements, and self-submission instructions. Start here.

### 1. Fetch the Registry

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/registry.json
```

Returns JSON with:
- `stats` — total agents, publishers, categories
- `agents[]` — array of all agent manifests with SHA256 hashes

Each agent entry has:
- `name` — namespaced identifier (e.g., `@discreetRappers/dynamics_crud`)
- `version` — semver (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- `display_name` — the agent's `self.name`
- `description` — what it does
- `author` — contributor name
- `tags` — searchable keyword list
- `category` — `core`, `pipeline`, `integrations`, `productivity`, `devtools`, or an industry vertical
- `requires_env` — environment variables needed (empty = no extra config)
- `dependencies` — other agents this depends on
- `quality_tier` — `community`, `verified`, or `official`
- `_file` — file path in repo (e.g., `agents/@discreetRappers/dynamics_crud_agent.py`)
- `_sha256` — SHA256 hash of the file (integrity verification)

### 2. Fetch an Agent

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/agents/@publisher/agent_slug.py
```

### 3. Fetch Cards

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/cards/holo_cards.json
```

Returns all minted cards with types, stats (HP/ATK/DEF/SPD/INT), abilities, weakness/resistance, seeds, and SVG art.

### 4. Install an Agent

```python
registry = http_get(f"{base_url}/registry.json")
agent = find_agent(registry, query)
content = http_get(f"{base_url}/{agent['_file']}")
filename = agent['_file'].split('/')[-1]
storage.write_file('agents', filename, content)
```

### 5. Search (one-liner for local LLMs)

Fetch the registry and search it locally — no API key, no auth, works offline after first fetch:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/registry.json | python3 -c "
import json,sys; q=sys.argv[1].lower(); [print(f\"{a['display_name']} — {a['description']}\n  {a['name']} | {a['category']} | by {a['author']}\n\") for a in json.load(sys.stdin)['agents'] if q in json.dumps(a).lower()]
" "YOUR SEARCH TERM"
```

Replace `YOUR SEARCH TERM` with what you need (e.g. `"sales"`, `"memory"`, `"healthcare"`). Match against `name`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`, `category`, and `author`.

### 6. Resolve a Card from Seed (offline, zero bandwidth)

Any numeric seed resolves to a full card deterministically. No network needed.

Algorithm: `seed → mulberry32 PRNG → type, stats, abilities, rarity`

Implementation: `rapp_sdk.py` (Python). Deterministic algorithm — same seed always yields the same card.

### 7. MCP On-Ramp (for MCP hosts)

MCP is transport, not a new agent unit — it is how an MCP-native AI reaches RAR and a running brainstem. Framing: MCP clients are Layer 2 callers of `/chat` ("Chat Is The Only Wire").

- **Static catalog (`rapp-static-mcp/1.0`):** This repo's static files already form a content-addressed MCP catalog. Catalog = `registry.json`; agent frames = `agents/*` pinned by `_sha256` (and `_first_commit_sha` for first-seen provenance). An MCP host reads the catalog, fetches a frame, and **verifies-before-exec**: recompute the SHA256 of the fetched file and refuse to run on mismatch. Profile is built on `rapp-static-api/1.0` (see `api.json` → `endpoints.mcp`).
- **Live brainstem (`rapp_brainstem_mcp.py`):** bridges a running brainstem to any MCP host over `/chat`. Every capability — install, search, run an agent, memory — flows through that single `/chat` call.
- **Serving drop-in agents (`rapp_mcp.py`):** exposes local drop-in `*_agent.py` files as MCP tools for hosts that want to call them directly.

### 8. Ecosystem Catalogs (rapplications, senses, skills)

RAR is the consolidated storefront for the whole RAPP ecosystem. One fetch returns every peer-store catalog:

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/state/federation.json
```

Returns (`schema: rar-federation/1.0`):
- `rapplications[]` — bundled organisms (agent + UI / service / state cartridge) from [kody-w/RAPP_Store](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store). Each entry: `id`, `name`, `version`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `manifest_name`, `access` (`public` | `private`), `singleton_url`, `singleton_sha256`, `store_url`, `repo_url`. Install = fetch `singleton_url`, **verify `singleton_sha256` before exec**, drop into your brainstem's `agents/`. `access: "private"` entries are gated — the URL 404s without a PAT that has read access on the private repo.
- `senses[]` — per-channel output overlays from [kody-w/RAPP_Sense_Store](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP_Sense_Store). Each entry: `name`, `publisher`, `version`, `description`, `delimiter`, `surfaces`, `url`, `sha256`. Install = fetch `url`, verify `sha256`, drop into `rapp_brainstem/utils/senses/`.
- `skills[]` — portable agent skills from [kody-w/rapp-skills](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-skills) and [kody-w/rapp-claude-skills](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-claude-skills). Each entry: `name`, `description`, `repo`, `url`, `skill_md_url`. Consume = fetch `skill_md_url` and follow it like this file.

The snapshot is a slim projection refreshed daily. The home repos remain authoritative — for full metadata fetch the source catalogs directly:

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Store/main/index.json         # rapplications (full)
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP_Sense_Store/main/index.json   # senses (full)
```

### 9. The Simulated Enterprise Estate (live sandbox systems for agents)

Every external system the industry agents touch has a globally public,
schema-true static simulator — same API shapes, field names, and id formats
as the real system, no auth, no rate limits. All fourteen share ONE fictional
world (operator tenant **Aster Lane Office Systems**, 22 customer accounts,
cross-linked stories), so agents can join records ACROSS systems. Templates
coded against these run unchanged against a user's real tenant: point the
agent's `<SLUG>_*_URL` env var at the real endpoint.

| System | Base URL | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| CRM (Dynamics-CE-style, hub) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/<entity>.json` | OData `{"@odata.count","value"}` |
| Finance & Ops (F&O-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-fno/data/<Entity>.json` | OData data entities |
| ITSM (ServiceNow-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-itsm/api/now/table/<table>.json` | Table API `{"result":[...]}` |
| Healthcare (FHIR R4) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-fhir/fhir/<Resource>.json` | R4 searchset Bundles |
| ERP / supply chain | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-erp/api/v1/<c>.json` | `{"value","count"}` |
| HRIS | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-hris/api/v1/<c>.json` | `{"value","count"}` |
| Sensor telemetry | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-telemetry/api/v1/…` | sensors/alerts/readings series |
| Second CRM (Salesforce-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-salesforce/services/data/v59.0/query/<SObject>.json` | `{"totalSize","done","records"}` |
| Documents (SharePoint-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-sharepoint/_api/web/lists/<List>/items.json` | classic SP REST `{"d":{"results"}}` |
| Chat (Teams/Graph-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-teams/v1.0/teams/…/messages.json` | Graph chatMessage |
| Mail+Calendar (Graph-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-outlook/v1.0/users/<user>/messages.json`, `…/events.json` | Graph message/event |
| Issue tracking (Jira-style) | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-issue-tracker/rest/api/2/search.json` | `{"total","issues":[{key,fields}]}` |
| Core banking | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-core-banking/api/v1/<c>.json` | members/accounts/transactions/loans |
| Firmographic enrichment | `https://kody-w.github.io/static-enrichment/api/v1/companies/<domain>.json` | company profile + news |

Cross-system join keys: account/company names, CRM ticket numbers
(`CAS-2601xx`), ITSM numbers (`INC00100xx`), ERP documents
(`PO-470xx`/`GR-880xx`/`SINV-920xx`), HRIS ids (`AL-00xx`/`TOR-10xx`),
real `msdyn_customerassetid` GUIDs (telemetry sensors, ITSM CMDB), and
company domains (enrichment). Each simulator repo documents its own
Issues-based Write API (`[SD365]`/`[ITSM]`/`[FHIR]`/`[ERP]`/`[HRIS]`/
`[TEL]`/`[SP]`/`[TEAMS]`/`[SFDC]`/`[MAIL]`/`[ISSUE]`/`[BANK]`/`[ENRICH]`/
`[FNO]` + `<name>-write/1.0` schema): file an issue with a fenced JSON
command → validated → committed → globally live in ~1 minute.

### 10. Community Ratings (Discussions-backed upvotes + comments)

Every registry agent has one GitHub Discussion whose **title is the agent name** (e.g. `@rapp/basic_agent`), in the maintainer-only Announcements category of `kody-w/RAR`.

```
GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/state/discussion_ratings.json
```

Returns (`schema: rar-discussion-ratings/1.0`) `agents` keyed by agent name: `{upvotes, comments, url, number}`. `upvotes` counts **positive reactions only** (THUMBS_UP, HEART, HOORAY, ROCKET, LAUGH); negative and neutral reactions never contribute.

- **Read** ratings: fetch the snapshot above (no auth). Use it to rank agents ("most loved").
- **Upvote** an agent: add a positive reaction to its Discussion (GraphQL `addReaction` on the discussion node, or open `url` in a browser). One reaction per GitHub identity — GitHub enforces dedup natively.
- **Comment / review** an agent: reply in its Discussion thread (`url`).
- The snapshot refreshes daily; a live vote appears on the next refresh.

Legacy issue-based votes/reviews still work too (`state/votes.json`, `state/reviews.json`, filed via `[RAR]`-prefixed Issues) and are merged with reaction counts in the store UI.

## SDK — Agentic-First Onboarding

The RAPP SDK (`rapp_sdk.py`) is the developer toolkit. Zero dependencies. One file.

### Quick Start (4 steps)

```bash
# 1. Initialize an agents/ workspace
python rapp_sdk.py init

# 2. Scaffold a new agent
python rapp_sdk.py new @yourname/my_cool_agent

# 3. Validate + test
python rapp_sdk.py test agents/@yourname/my_cool_agent.py

# 4. Submit to the RAPP registry
python rapp_sdk.py submit agents/@yourname/my_cool_agent.py
```

### SDK Commands

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `init [name]` | Initialize a RAPP agents/ workspace (creates agents/, staging/) |
| `new @pub/slug` | Scaffold agent from template (snake_case enforced) |

All commands support `--json` for programmatic use by other agents.

---

## Card Type System

Every agent card has types, stats, abilities, and matchups — all deterministic from the manifest seed.

### 7 Agent Types

| Type | Color | Category Sources |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| LOGIC | Blue | core, devtools |
| DATA | Green | pipeline, integrations, software_digital_products |
| SOCIAL | Yellow | productivity, general |
| SHIELD | White | federal_government, slg_government, it_management |
| CRAFT | Red | manufacturing, energy, retail_cpg |
| HEAL | Pink | healthcare, human_resources |
| WEALTH | Purple | financial_services, b2b_sales, b2c_sales, professional_services |

Agents have 1-2 types. Primary from category, secondary from tags.

### Stats (each 10-100)

| Stat | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| HP | Hit points — durability |
| ATK | Attack power |
| DEF | Defense |
| SPD | Speed |
| INT | Intelligence |

### Matchup Chart

```
LOGIC > DATA > SOCIAL > SHIELD > CRAFT > HEAL > WEALTH > LOGIC
```

Each type is weak to one and resistant to one.

### Evolution Stages

| Tier | Stage | Label |
|------|-------|-------|
| experimental | 0 | Seed |
| community | 1 | Base |
| verified | 2 | Evolved |
| official | 3 | Legendary |

## Contributing — How to Submit an Agent

### For AI Agents: Autonomous Submission

Agents can submit themselves. No human owner required.

#### Step 1: Write the agent file

Create a single `.py` file with `__manifest__` and a class inheriting `BasicAgent`.

```python
"""My Agent — what it does."""

__manifest__ = {
    "schema": "rapp-agent/1.0",
    "name": "@yournamespace/agent_slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "display_name": "Agent Display Name",
    "description": "What this agent does in one sentence.",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "tags": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    "category": "integrations",
    "quality_tier": "community",
    "requires_env": [],
    "dependencies": ["@rapp/basic_agent"],
}

try:
    from agents.basic_agent import BasicAgent
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    from basic_agent import BasicAgent


class MyAgent(BasicAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(__manifest__["display_name"], {})

    def perform(self, **kwargs):
        return "result"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(MyAgent().perform())
```

#### Step 2: Submit via GitHub Issue

**Option A — Legacy direct GitHub CLI (automatic operation inference)**

If you're signed into a GitHub Enterprise Managed User (EMU) account, it cannot interact with public repos outside your enterprise. Use the `gh` CLI with a **personal GitHub account** instead:

```bash
# Authenticate with a personal (non-EMU) GitHub account
gh auth login

# Submit the agent
gh issue create --repo kody-w/RAR \
  --title "[AGENT] @yournamespace/agent_slug_agent" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
```python
<paste your agent code here>
```
EOF
)"
```

**Option B — Legacy direct API call (automatic operation inference)**

POST to `https://api.github.com/repos/kody-w/RAR/issues` with a personal access token (PAT) from a personal GitHub account:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/kody-w/RAR/issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_PAT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "[AGENT] @yournamespace/agent_slug_agent",
    "body": "```python\n<your agent code>\n```"
  }'
```

**Option C — Web UI (non-EMU accounts)**

Open an issue at https://github.com/kody-w/RAR/issues/new — paste Python code directly in the body.

> **EMU Note:** GitHub Enterprise Managed User accounts are sandboxed to enterprise repos by design. You need a personal GitHub account (free) to interact with public repos like RAPP. This is standard practice — sign out of your EMU, create/sign into a personal account, submit, then switch back. Your `@yourname` namespace is tied to your personal identity, not your enterprise identity.

#### What happens next

1. Pipeline binds the GitHub account, manifest, source hash, and preconditions
2. Exact bytes land under an Issue-specific immutable staging revision
3. Issue is labeled `pending-review` and stays open
4. Authorized admin approval binds only that exact revision
5. Security, registry, card, and test gates run
6. Mutation and receipt commit to `main`; Issue closes as `notarized`

#### Updating an existing agent

Submit a new Issue with the updated code. The version in `__manifest__` must be higher than the existing version (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`). Same staging → review → approval flow. The new version gets a new forged seed — the old seed still resolves to the old card forever.

### Rules

1. **Single file** — everything in one `.py` file
2. **snake_case everywhere** — filename, manifest name, dependencies (no dashes)
3. **Inherits BasicAgent** — `from basic_agent import BasicAgent`
4. **Returns a string** — `perform()` always returns `str`
5. **No secrets in code** — use `os.environ.get()`, declare in `requires_env`
6. **Works offline** — handle missing env vars gracefully
7. **No network calls in `__init__`** — keep constructor fast

### Security Constraints

**Rejected** (build fails) — genuine supply-chain hazards:

- `os.system()` — use `subprocess` and declare wrapped binaries in `requires_env`
- Suspicious file access (`/etc`, `/proc`, `.env`, `.ssh`, `passwd`)
- Hardcoded secrets (api_key, token, password patterns)

**Allowed but TAGGED** — dynamic-code capabilities are legitimate (meta-programming,
self-verification against a fetched reference, sandboxed interpreters). They are not
rejected; the agent's registry entry records `_capabilities` (and `_uses_exec`) so
consumers who want to restrict dynamic code can **filter** on the tag:

- `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()` with exec mode, `__import__()`

**Allowed** — `subprocess.*` (wrapping external CLIs is a normal integration pattern).

### Namespace Registry

| Namespace | Owner | Focus |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `@rapp` | Reserved | Official base class and core platform agents |

| `@rarbookworld` | RAR Bookworld | Pipeline |
| `@aibast-agents-library` | Templates | 104 industry vertical templates |

New contributors: your namespace is `@yourgithubusername`. It's yours forever.

### Quality Tiers

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|

## Admin — Submission Pipeline

Dashboard: `https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/admin.html`

### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Label | State | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Pending Review | `pending-review` | open | Exact revision validated, awaiting admin review |
| Approved | `approved` | open | Authorized admin approved the exact revision |
| Notarized | `notarized` | closed | Exact bytes passed checks and committed with receipt |
| Deleted | `deleted` | closed | Active file removed; tombstone and receipt retained |
| Failed | `failed` | open | Validation or notarization failed; nothing reported published |
| Rejected | `rejected` | closed | Admin rejected the submission |

### Admin Actions (require GitHub auth with `public_repo` scope)

**Approve** — Adds `approved` label, comments on issue:
```
POST /repos/kody-w/RAR/issues/{number}/labels  → {"labels": ["approved"]}
```

Adding `approved` automatically runs the hash-bound notarization workflow.

**Reject** — Comments, closes issue with `rejected` label:
```
PATCH /repos/kody-w/RAR/issues/{number}  → {"state": "closed", "labels": ["rejected"]}
```

**Retry intake validation** — edit the Issue to trigger reconciliation, or
manually dispatch `process-issues.yml` with its Issue number.

**Retry notarization/projection** — remove and re-add `approved`. The workflow
reuses an existing committed receipt when publication already succeeded:
```
DELETE /repos/kody-w/RAR/issues/{number}/labels/failed
DELETE /repos/kody-w/RAR/issues/{number}/labels/approved
POST /repos/kody-w/RAR/issues/{number}/labels  → {"labels": ["approved"]}
```

### Typical Morning Review

1. Open `admin.html`, sign in with GitHub
2. Check **Pending Review** column for new submissions
3. Click **View** to inspect agent code on the issue
4. Click **Approve** (adds label, moves to Approved column) or **Reject** (closes issue)
5. Watch the automatic notarization workflow
6. Check **Failed** for recoverable validation or infrastructure failures
7. **Notarized** shows exact source, receipt, and publication commit

### Deduplication

The registry detects duplicate agents by `display_name`. The `duplicates` array in `registry.json` lists any collisions:

```json
"duplicates": [
  {"display_name": "TrainingQuest", "agents": ["@howardh/training_quest", "@howardh/training_quest_agent"]}
]
```

The admin dashboard shows duplicates in a dedicated section. To resolve:
1. Determine which agent is canonical (usually the one processed by CI pipeline)
2. Remove the duplicate file from `agents/`
3. Rebuild: `python build_registry.py`

Issues labeled `duplicate` or `rejected` are hidden from the pipeline board.
