"""
Financial Services Regulatory Compliance Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Manages compliance dashboards, regulation tracking, remediation planning,
and examination preparation for financial institution compliance teams.
In this template a compliance finding is represented as a Dynamics 365
case and a remediation action as a Dynamics task — the tenant has no
native regulatory entities, so the case/task queue stands in for the
findings register and remediation tracker.

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box the flagship `remediation_plan` operation pulls live
     task and case records over real HTTP from the globally hosted Static
     Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office Systems — synthetic data, no
     credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     Try: perform(operation="remediation_plan")
     and look for "Records request backlog exceeds statutory deadline"
     with its "Review service notes — CAS-260131" remediation task.
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (REGULATIONS / EXAMINATION_FINDINGS / REMEDIATION_PLANS) — the agent
     never crashes offline.
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     FS_REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint (your
     real Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your GRC platform), or
     replace _fetch_collection() with your own client. The fields the
     rest of the file needs are listed in _normalize_live_remediation()
     — the regulation column stays "n/a — enrichment seam" until you
     wire your obligations register.
