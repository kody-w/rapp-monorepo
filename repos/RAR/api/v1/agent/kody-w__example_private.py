"""
Example gated stub — the actual agent.py lives in a private repo.

This file is metadata only. Public RAR lists it so the agent is
discoverable; the brainstem resolves __source__ at install time using
the user's own GitHub credentials. If the user can read the private
repo, they get the bytes. If not, they get a clean access-denied
message.

Stubs may contain ONLY:
  - a module docstring (this block)
  - __manifest__ = { ... }
  - __source__   = { ... }

Anything else (functions, classes, imports, executable code) is
rejected by build_registry.py — stubs are pure metadata.
