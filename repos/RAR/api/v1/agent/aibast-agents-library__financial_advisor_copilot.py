"""
Financial Advisor Copilot Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Assists financial advisors with client reviews, portfolio summaries,
investment recommendations, and compliance checks. In this template a CRM
contact is an advisory client — the tenant has no native portfolio entity,
so the client book comes from contacts and balances stay an enrichment
seam until you wire your custodian.

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box the flagship `client_review` operation pulls live
     contact records over real HTTP from the globally hosted Static
     Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office Systems — synthetic data, no
     credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     Try: perform(operation="client_review")
     and look for Marcus Webb, the Bluegrass Credit Union contact.
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (CLIENT_PORTFOLIOS / COMPLIANCE_RULES) — the agent never crashes
     offline.
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     FINANCIAL_ADVISOR_COPILOT_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint (your
     real Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your book-of-business
     system), or replace _fetch_collection() with your own client. The
     fields the rest of the file needs are listed in
     _normalize_live_client() — fields rendered "n/a — enrichment seam"
     (assets, age, risk profile) are where you wire your custodian and
     planning platform.
