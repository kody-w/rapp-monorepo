"""
Fraud Detection & Alert Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Provides alert triage, transaction analysis, pattern detection, and
investigation summaries for financial fraud operations teams. In this
template a fraud investigation is represented as a Dynamics 365 case —
the tenant has no native fraud-case entity, so the service-case queue
stands in for the fraud ops investigation queue (its seeded "Disputed
card transaction under investigation" case is exactly that story).

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box the flagship `investigation_summary` operation pulls
     live case records over real HTTP from the globally hosted Static
     Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office Systems — synthetic data, no
     credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     Try: perform(operation="investigation_summary")
     and look for Bluegrass Credit Union's "Disputed card transaction
     under investigation" case.
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (TRANSACTIONS / INVESTIGATION_CASES) — the agent never crashes
     offline.
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     FRAUD_DETECTION_ALERT_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint (your
     real Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your fraud case manager),
     or replace _fetch_collection() with your own client. The fields the
     rest of the file needs are listed in _normalize_live_case() — the
     fraud pattern column stays "n/a — enrichment seam" until you wire
     your detection models.
