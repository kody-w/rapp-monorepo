"""
Claims Processing Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Supports the insurance claims lifecycle with intake, adjudication review,
fraud flagging, and settlement recommendations, plus five capability
operations (claim_triage, fraud_detection, auto_adjudication,
complex_claim_prep, performance_metrics) derived from the Claims
Processing external agent spec (rapp-external-agent-spec/1.0).

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box it pulls live claim records over real HTTP from the
     globally hosted Static Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office
     Systems — synthetic data, no credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     In this template a claim or dispute IS a Dynamics case at a
     financial-services account — e.g. CAS-260126 "Disputed card
     transaction under investigation" at Bluegrass Credit Union, and
     CAS-260127, member Marcus Webb's loan application review.
     Try: perform(operation="claim_intake")
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (CLAIMS / POLICY_DETAILS / FRAUD_INDICATORS / SPEC_CAPABILITIES) —
     the agent never crashes offline, and capability operations that
     stay canned keep saying "simulated".
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     CLAIMS_PROCESSING_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint (your real
     Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your claims platform), or
     replace _fetch_collection() with your own API client. Fields the
     rest of the file needs are listed in _normalize_live_claim() —
     everything else keeps working untouched. Fields marked "enrichment
     seam" in the output (policy numbers, claimed amounts, fraud
     scores) are where you wire your policy admin and fraud-scoring
     systems.
