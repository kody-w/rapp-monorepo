TufteLove — "Every pixel should earn its place." — Made by HOLO

UI design advisor for brainstem agents. Combines Edward Tufte's visual design
principles, Microsoft Aether Central Team's Agent Oversight Design Taxonomy
(32+ patterns), and 8 academic papers on human-agent interaction into a single
agent that shapes how all other agents create UI.

Provides always-on design awareness via system_context() plus on-demand
deep dives into patterns, checklists, and reviews.

## 5 Usage Examples

1. "Review my dashboard HTML for design issues"
   → TufteLove action=review, source="./deliverables/my-dashboard.html"
   → Structured feedback: data-ink violations, missing oversight patterns, Tufte improvements

2. "How should I design approval flows for a financial agent?"
   → TufteLove action=guide, topic="approval flows"
   → Deep dive: Before 3.2 plan review, During 2.1 approval requests, risk patterns

3. "What does Tufte say about designing data-heavy agent dashboards?"
   → TufteLove action=tufte
   → Small multiples, sparklines, micro/macro readings, layering for agent UIs

4. "Give me a UI checklist for a high-risk medical agent"
   → TufteLove action=checklist, topic="high-risk medical agent"
   → Tailored checklist: mandatory approval gates, audit trails, undo/reversal

5. "Show me all the oversight patterns I should consider"
   → TufteLove action=patterns
   → 32+ patterns organized by Before/During/After with descriptions

_TUFTE_PRINCIPLES = """## Edward Tufte's Principles for Agent UI — Made by HOLO

### 1. Data-Ink Ratio
Maximize the share of "ink" (pixels) dedicated to actual data/content. Remove every
border, shadow, gradient, background, and decoration that doesn't directly convey
information. In agent UIs: status indicators should be data, not decoration.

### 2. Chartjunk Elimination
No ornamental icons, 3D effects, or visual noise. Every element must earn its pixels.
In agent UIs: avoid decorative loading animations, gratuitous emoji walls, or styled
containers that add visual weight without meaning.

### 3. Small Multiples
Show series of similar charts/panels with consistent scale and layout for instant
comparison. In agent UIs: use card grids for multi-agent status, consistent layouts
for step-by-step plan views, or repeated panels for A/B comparisons.

### 4. Sparklines
"Data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics." Inline trend indicators that
convey history without taking space. In agent UIs: embed tiny progress bars, trend
arrows, or mini-charts next to KPIs and status fields.

### 5. Micro/Macro Readings
Users should see both fine details AND the big picture simultaneously. Don't force
a choice between overview and detail. In agent UIs: show summary + expandable detail
in the same view; use progressive disclosure but keep context visible.

### 6. Layering & Separation
Use color, spacing, opacity, and whitespace to organize visual hierarchy without
physical borders. In agent UIs: distinguish active/completed/pending states through
color intensity, not heavy outlines. Push secondary info to lighter visual weight.

### 7. Escape from Flatland
Encode multiple dimensions without literal 3D: use position, color, size, shape.
In agent UIs: a single status card can show state (color), progress (bar width),
risk (icon), and timing (position) simultaneously.

### 8. Graphical Integrity
Represent data honestly and proportionally. No misleading scales, truncated axes,
or cherry-picked ranges. In agent UIs: progress bars must reflect actual progress,
confidence scores must be calibrated, time estimates must be honest.

### 9. Narrative Evidence
UI should tell a coherent story guiding the user through data exploration or task
completion. Sequence matters. In agent UIs: structure output as a narrative flow —
what was done → what was found → what needs attention → what's next.

### 10. Data Density
Don't fear dense information if well-organized. Users can process more than assumed.
In agent UIs: don't over-simplify dashboards to 3 metrics when users need 20 —
organize them well instead. Use small multiples and layering to pack information
without clutter.

_PAPER_INSIGHTS = """## Academic Foundations — Made by HOLO

### Bansal et al. 2024 — Communication Challenges
12 challenges (A1-A5 agent→user, U1-U3 user→agent, X1-X4 cross-cutting).
Key: Make plans, permissions, progress, and outcomes legible — not just chatty.

### Mozannar et al. 2025 — Magentic-UI
6 mechanisms: co-planning, co-tasking, action guards, verification, memory, multi-tasking.
Key: Build for low-cost interruption and recovery; make control continuous, not one-shot.

### Dibia et al. 2024 — AutoGen Studio
Composable primitives, trace views, reusable templates, session comparison.
Key: Recommend composable UI patterns and inspection/debugging views.

### Methnani et al. 2021 — Variable Autonomy
Meaningful human control via accountability, responsibility, transparency.
Key: Let users DIAL autonomy up/down by task/risk — not binary approve/deny.

### Sterz et al. 2024 — Effective Oversight
Effectiveness = causal power + epistemic access + self-control + fitting intentions.
Key: If the user can't meaningfully intervene, the oversight UI is performative.

### Verhagen et al. 2024 — Traceability
Traceability is the key measurable construct for meaningful human control.
Key: Pair live telemetry with post-hoc explainability and reason capture.

### Reinmund et al. 2024 — Autonomy State Machine
Variable autonomy needs governed transitions, not ad-hoc switching.
Key: Treat autonomy as a state machine with explicit modes and transition rules.

### Nyholm 2024 — Meaningful Control
Control is multi-dimensional and context-dependent.
Key: Recommend control only where it affects safety, accountability, or user values.

            "They combine Tufte's visual design, Aether's oversight taxonomy, and academic research.\n\n"
            "### 1. Data-Ink Ratio *(Tufte)*\n"
            "Maximize meaningful content, minimize decoration. Every pixel must earn its place.\n\n"
            "### 2. Progressive Disclosure *(Aether Taxonomy)*\n"
            "Start simple, reveal complexity as needed. Don't overwhelm — layer information.\n\n"
            "### 3. Micro/Macro Readings *(Tufte)*\n"
            "Show detail AND big picture simultaneously. Don't force a choice between overview and detail.\n\n"
            "### 4. Transparent Boundaries *(Aether Taxonomy)*\n"
            "Always clear what the agent can and cannot do. 🟢 Can do 🟡 Needs approval 🔴 Cannot do.\n\n"
            "### 5. Variable Autonomy *(Methnani et al. 2021)*\n"
            "Let users dial control up/down by task and risk — not binary approve/deny.\n"
            "Three levels: human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, human-out-of-the-loop.\n\n"
            "### 6. Effective Oversight *(Sterz et al. 2024)*\n"
            "If the user can't meaningfully intervene, the oversight UI is performative.\n"
            "Real oversight = causal power + epistemic access + self-control.\n\n"
            "### 7. Layering & Separation *(Tufte)*\n"
            "Organize visual hierarchy with color, spacing, opacity, whitespace — not borders.\n"
            "Push secondary info to lighter visual weight. No heavy containers.\n\n"
            "### 8. User Empowerment *(Aether Taxonomy)*\n"
            "Observable: user can see what's happening. Interruptible: user can pause/stop.\n"
            "Reversible: user can undo where possible.\n\n"
            "### 9. Small Multiples *(Tufte)*\n"
            "Consistent layouts for comparison. Card grids, step views, dashboard panels.\n"
            "Same scale, same axes, side by side.\n\n"
            "### 10. Traceability *(Verhagen et al. 2024)*\n"
            "Pair live telemetry with post-hoc explainability. Every decision traceable.\n"
            "Users must be able to answer: what happened, when, why, and can I reverse it?\n\n"
