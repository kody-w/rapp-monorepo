Rappterpedia Content Engine 📚
Autonomous wiki & forum content generation following the RAPPterverse
rules-as-data pattern. Articles and threads are defined as DATA
(templates + context), not code. Adding new content types = adding
a dict entry, zero code changes.

Generates wiki articles, forum threads, and replies that build out
the Rappterpedia knowledge base with genuine, useful content about
the RAPP Agent ecosystem.

Usage:
  Single tick:  python rappterpedia/rappterpedia_engine.py
  Dry run:      python rappterpedia/rappterpedia_engine.py --dry-run
  No git:       python rappterpedia/rappterpedia_engine.py --no-push
  Seed only:    python rappterpedia/rappterpedia_engine.py --seed
  Full burst:   python rappterpedia/rappterpedia_engine.py --burst 20

This confirms your Python version and project structure are correct.\n\n### 2. Understand the Pattern\n\nEvery agent in RAPP follows the same structure: a `__manifest__` dict at module level, a class inheriting from `BasicAgent`, and a `perform(**kwargs)` method that returns a string.\n\n### 3. Apply It\n\nFor {topic_lower}, the key is to follow existing patterns. Look at agents in the `agents/` directory for reference implementations. The best way to learn is by reading working code.\n\n### 4. Validate\n\nRun `python build_registry.py` to check your manifest, then `pytest tests/test_agent_contract.py` to run the full contract test suite.",
                    "### 1. Start Simple\n\nDon't try to build everything at once. Start with the minimal working version and iterate.\n\n### 2. Follow the Conventions\n\nRAPP has clear conventions for {topic_lower} — file naming, manifest fields, class structure. Following them means the tooling works for you automatically.\n\n### 3. Test Locally\n\n```bash\npython build_registry.py\npytest tests/test_agent_contract.py -k \"your-agent\"\n```\n\n### 4. Ship It\n\nOnce tests pass, submit via PR or the Agent Store workbench.",

Returning `None`, `dict`, or `int` will fail contract tests.\n- **Hardcoded secrets** — Use `os.environ.get()` and declare in `requires_env`. Never hardcode API keys.\n- **display_name mismatch** — The manifest's `display_name` must match `self.name` in your class.",

- RAPP (RAPP Agent Registry) is an open single-file agent ecosystem
- Every agent is ONE .py file with a __manifest__ dict, a BasicAgent subclass, and a perform() method
- The registry builder uses AST parsing (no code execution) to extract manifests
- Categories: core, pipeline, integrations, productivity, devtools, plus industry verticals
- Quality tiers: community → verified → official
- The Agent Store is a zero-dependency single HTML file
- Agents use os.environ.get() for secrets, declared in requires_env
- perform() always returns a string

Write in a clear, practical style. Be specific and useful. No filler. No generic advice.
