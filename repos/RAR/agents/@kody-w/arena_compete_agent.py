"""
ArenaCompete — run a COMPETITION of player-agents in the commons, judge each round, and pull the
BOTTOM performer up by adjusting its strategy toward what made the TOP performer better last round
(dynamic learning). It's the EZsharpen self-improvement pattern applied to players: many drivers
each control a tab/strategy, they're scored each round, and the laggard learns from the leader —
so the whole field climbs round over round, and you (or the brainstem) can drop in and compete too.

THE LOOP (per round):
  1. Each competitor plays a round with its current strategy (live: drive a real commons tab via the
     Matrix Arena harness and score from the real signed stream / exploration; sim: a deterministic
     score so the learning is testable without a live browser).
  2. JUDGE: rank competitors by score.
  3. PULL UP THE BOTTOM: nudge the lowest scorer's strategy toward the leader's — `bottom += lr *
     (top - bottom)` — i.e., adopt *what made the better competitor better*. A little exploration
     noise keeps it from collapsing. (The strongest may also be perturbed slightly to keep searching.)
  4. Repeat — the field's average score rises and the gap shrinks; the bottom is never left behind.

Strategy vector (each in [0,1]): explore (move/cover ground), act (land signed actions), social
(say/relate). The score rewards a balance the round happens to favor; learning discovers it.

Drop-in (BasicAgent), pure stdlib core (live mode shells to ~/.brainstem/matrix_tabs.py). No PII.

Actions:
  compete  run the dynamic-learning competition (players, rounds[, live]) -> scoreboard evolution
  demo     self-test: prove the bottom performer climbs toward the leader over rounds
