"""
Customer Sentiment & Churn Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Analyzes customer sentiment, predicts churn risk, recommends retention
actions, and provides segment-level insights for financial institutions.
In this template an account is a customer relationship and a support case
is a complaint/sentiment signal — the tenant has no native NPS entity, so
case volume and priority stand in for dissatisfaction signals.

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box the flagship `churn_prediction` operation pulls live
     account and case records over real HTTP from the globally hosted
     Static Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office Systems — synthetic
     data, no credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     Try: perform(operation="churn_prediction")
     and look for Bluegrass Credit Union's open "Disputed card
     transaction under investigation" case driving its risk score.
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (CUSTOMER_INTERACTIONS / CHURN_INDICATORS) — the agent never crashes
     offline.
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     CUSTOMER_SENTIMENT_CHURN_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint (your
     real Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your case/survey system), or
     replace _fetch_collection() with your own client. The fields the rest
     of the file needs are listed in _normalize_live_customer() — fields
     rendered "n/a — enrichment seam" (NPS, transactions, digital
     engagement) are where you wire your survey and core banking systems.
