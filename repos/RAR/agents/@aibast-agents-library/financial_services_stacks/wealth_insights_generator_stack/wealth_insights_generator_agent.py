"""
Wealth Insights Generator Agent — a template you are meant to mutate.

Generates market briefs, client insights, opportunity alerts, and
performance attribution reports for wealth management teams. In this
template a client opportunity alert is represented as an open Dynamics
365 opportunity — the tenant has no native planning-signal entity, so the
open pipeline stands in for the advisor's opportunity radar.

HOW THIS TEMPLATE WORKS
  1. Out of the box the flagship `opportunity_alerts` operation pulls
     live opportunity records over real HTTP from the globally hosted
     Static Dynamics 365 tenant (Aster Lane Office Systems — synthetic
     data, no credentials, works from anywhere):
     https://kody-w.github.io/static-dynamics-365/api/data/v9.2/
     Try: perform(operation="opportunity_alerts")
     and look for "Orchard Signal Works — Managed print fleet refresh"
     among the high-priority alerts.
  2. No network? Everything falls back to the embedded demo layer below
     (CLIENT_PORTFOLIOS / OPPORTUNITY_SIGNALS) — the agent never crashes
     offline.
  3. Make it yours at the LIVE DATA SEAM below: set
     WEALTH_INSIGHTS_GENERATOR_DATA_URL to any OData-shaped endpoint
     (your real Dynamics org, or JSON exported from your planning
     platform), or replace _fetch_collection() with your own client. The
     fields the rest of the file needs are listed in
     _normalize_live_alert() — life events and planning context are
     enrichment seams until you wire your CRM notes and planning tools.
