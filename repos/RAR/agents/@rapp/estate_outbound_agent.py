"""estate_outbound_agent.py — stage a signed event for federation roll-up.

The companion to commons_post_agent (and any future per-neighborhood post
agent): commons_post composes + the host signs, then this agent writes
the signed event to the operator's outbound lane (Article XLVIII), where
each neighborhood's federation roll-up can find it on its beat.

Outbound lane layout (on disk):

  ~/.brainstem/outbound/<sanitized-neighborhood-rappid>/<event-filename>.json

Filename:   <sha256(pub_jwk_canonical)[:16]>-<ts:replace ':' with '-'>.json
            (matches events/SCHEMA.md so the federation roll-up can union
             without renaming.)

The agent does NOT push the lane to a public estate repo — pushing is the
operator's responsibility (`git -C ~/.brainstem push estate-outbound main`
or equivalent). The agent prints the hint, surfaces what was staged, and
returns the path so the host UI can wire a "publish" button.

Future companion: an `estate_publish_agent` that wraps `git add/commit/push`
against the operator's public-estate remote, with provenance logged into
`~/.brainstem/bonds.json` per CONSTITUTION Article XLVIII.

Runs in any host that exposes BasicAgent (Pyodide tether, server brainstem,
swarm) — pure stdlib except for the (already-loaded) BasicAgent base.
