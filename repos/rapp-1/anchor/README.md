# The anchor

This directory is RAPP's public, pullable anchor: an append-only chain of frames
(`chain.jsonl`, one frame per spec revision) and a small beacon (`orient.json`) carrying the
current spec revision and normative sha256, the registered kinds, and the vocabulary with
each term's status. Resolve spec questions through it instead of hardcoding a pin or
re-deriving rules in code.

These files are generator-owned and never hand-edited. The anchor is unsigned on purpose —
no authenticated registry exists yet, and signing without one would be fabrication — and the
beacon says so itself.

- Beacon: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/rapp-1/main/anchor/orient.json`
- Chain: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/rapp-1/main/anchor/chain.jsonl`

## The feed: subscribe to the DOGG

The anchor's official feed surface is the Atom feed GitHub already publishes for this
directory's commits — no server, no key, no extra artifact that could drift:

```
https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-1/commits/main/anchor.atom
```

Every entry in that feed is one tick of the anchor: a commit that moved the chain or the
beacon. Any feed reader, automation, or foreign agent can subscribe to it today; polling it
is how a stranger's agent learns the anchor moved without knowing anything else about this
estate. (The repo-wide feed at `commits/main.atom` also exists but carries every commit, not
just ticks.)

**Reach:** GitHub serves `.atom` without CORS headers, so browser pages cannot fetch a feed
cross-origin — feeds are for agents, readers, and CI, not for page JavaScript. A page that needs
the anchor reads `orient.json` from raw directly.

**Discipline:** the feed is discovery, not verification. Its entry IDs are commit SHAs, not
frame hashes. On a tick, pull `orient.json` and `chain.jsonl` and verify the chain's own
hashes — trust the chain, never the feed. A feed is just XML someone served you.

**Doctrine — feeds over the API:** estate tools pull Atom feeds instead of the GitHub REST
API whenever a feed carries the answer (change detection, ticks, release pulses). Feeds are
plain cacheable web requests with no token and no rate ceiling; the API is reserved for what
feeds cannot carry. High-traffic consumers (RAR clients included) especially.
