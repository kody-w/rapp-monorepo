"""07 — Your own estate. Extending RAPP without touching rapp-1.

RAPP grows by registration (Constitution Art. 4). A vendor, a team, or one laptop
becomes an *estate* by publishing its own §13 registry: that document — not this
repository — binds the estate's kinds to families, admits its egg variants and
error codes, discovers its signers' keys, and retires keys by tombstone. This
program writes such a registry for a fictional estate ("acme"), then checks real
frames against it with the reference. Run: python3 examples/07_your_own_estate.py

Nothing here is signed. An unsigned registry is a DRAFT; the reference says so and
never calls it verified. The stand-in SPKI bytes are not a key.
