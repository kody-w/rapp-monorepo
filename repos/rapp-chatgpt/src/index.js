## MCP servers (streamable HTTP, no auth)

- [Agent Builder](${origin}/mcp): get_agent_template, check_agent, use_agent_here, find_agents, get_agent_code, share_agent, how_to_run_agent
- [Agent Finder](${origin}/finder/mcp): find_agents, get_agent_code, use_agent_here, how_to_run_agent
- [World Check](${origin}/world/mcp): world_now, fingerprint_text
- [Domain Check](${origin}/domains/mcp): check_domain, register_domain

## Pay per call (x402 v2, USDC)

- GET ${origin}/x402/world: fresh verified world snapshot, $0.001
- POST ${origin}/x402/domains/register?domain=NAME: register an available domain; the 402 response quotes the price; charged only if registration succeeds (raise your x402 client's default $1 per-payment cap first)

## A2A

- [Agent card](${origin}/.well-known/agent-card.json): JSON-RPC message/send at ${origin}/a2a. Skills: find_agents, world_now, agent_template.

## Docs

- [Website](${SITE}): what it does, in plain words
- [Source](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-chatgpt): server code, listing packages, tests
- [Agent registry](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/): the public agent registry
