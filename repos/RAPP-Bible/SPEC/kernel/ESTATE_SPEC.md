# ESTATE_SPEC — The Rappid Is The Global Address

> **Schema:** `rapp-estate/1.1` · **Status:** Constitutional (Article XLVI) · **Authority:** this file · **First shipped:** 2026-05-09

This is the load-bearing spec for **how any door (twin or neighborhood) is discovered and addressed across the network**. It locks in a property the rappid format has always implied but the codebase had not enforced: from a single rappid string, with zero auth and zero API calls, you can compute every canonical URL the door has and fetch its full identity from `raw.githubusercontent.com`.

If you are writing a planter, an estate agent, a federation walker, a holocard renderer, a discovery UI, or any code that maps from "I have a rappid" → "I want to read the door" — this spec is the contract. There are no fallbacks; the spec describes what is true.

> **2026-05-10 — estate is portable:** the entire estate (every door, every rappid, the door catalog, the public/private/on-device tiers per [`PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md`](./PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md)) is a planned `brainstem-egg/2.3-estate` cartridge. Substrate-migrate the whole identity by exporting → AirDropping/sneakernetting → re-anchoring on the new substrate via [`egg_hatcher_agent.py`](../../rapp_brainstem/agents/egg_hatcher_agent.py). The estate cartridge is the missing identity-portability primitive — paired with the rappid-as-global-address property below, the operator's whole digital identity becomes substrate-agnostic. See [SPEC.md §18.10](./SPEC.md) family table.

---

## 1. The rappid IS the URL

The **consolidated** rappid format (locked 2026-06-03):

```
rappid:@<owner>/<slug>:<64hex>
```

`@<owner>/<slug>` is the **location** — `github.com/<owner>/<slug>` is the door. From this string alone, by **string parsing** (not lookup, not config, not env), you derive every door URL in §2:

| Field | How |
|---|---|
| `owner` | Everything after `@` and before `/` |
| `repo` (`slug`) | Everything after `/` and before the final `:` |
| `hash` | The 64-hex after the final `:` — the 256-bit identity / join key |

`kind` (→ `door_type`) is **no longer in the string** — it lives in the door's `rappid.json` record (fetch the `identity` URL in §2). The pure-string `door_from_rappid()` returns the URLs (location) for any door; `kind`/`door_type` come from the record (or, for a legacy v2 string, are read inline). Legacy forms — v2 `rappid:v2:<kind>:@<owner>/<repo>:<32hex>@github.com/<owner>/<repo>` and bare UUIDs — are read-compatible via `door_address.py` (`canonicalize_rappid`).

**Valid kinds** (frozen as of 2026-05-09; **amended 2026-06-02** per CONSTITUTION Art. XLVI.2 to ratify the single-presence kinds already shipped across the kernel, RAR, and RAPP-Network): single AI presences → `front_door`: `twin`, `operator`, `personal`, `project`, `memorial`, `pre-founder`, `mirror`, `experiment`, `custom`; community spaces you enter → `gate`: `neighborhood`, `ant-farm`, `braintrust`, `workspace`, `hatched`, `rapplication`, `prototype`, `place`. Adding a new kind requires a CONSTITUTION amendment because every consumer derives behavior from this token; the canonical machine-readable set is `VALID_KINDS` / `_FRONT_DOOR_KINDS` in `tools/door_address.py` (the one parser consumers MUST import).

---

## 2. The Canonical Door URL Set

Every planted door MUST be reachable at these URLs. The planter MUST emit each one as appropriate to the door's type. A consumer holding a rappid MUST be able to fetch any of these URLs without an API call:

| # | Name | URL pattern | Required for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `repo` | `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` | all (the canonical browsing URL) |
| 2 | `front` | `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` | all (the heimdall snapshot — the operator-facing chat surface) |
| 3 | `identity` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/rappid.json` | all (`rapp-rappid/2.0`, which defers to `rapp-eternity/1.0` — the sole identity standard) |
| 4 | `holocard` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/card.json` | all (`rappcards/1.1.2`) |
| 5 | `holo_md` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo.md` | all (the friendly entry doc) |
| 6 | `avatar` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo.svg` | all (procedural sprite) |
| 7 | `summon_qr` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo-qr.svg` | all (QR encoding the front-door URL) |
| 8 | `members` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/members.json` | gates only (`rapp-neighborhood-members/1.0`) |
| 9 | `facets` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/facets.json` | all (`rapp-facets/1.0` — the door's published-capability declaration) |

**The .nojekyll + index.html invariant.** A planted door's index.html serves the heimdall front-door grail; for that to work over GitHub Pages, the repo MUST contain a `.nojekyll` file at root. The planter emits it. The backfill enforces it.

**The specs/ invariant.** Per "specs travel with the planted repo" (CONSTITUTION Article XXIII; memory: `feedback_specs_travel_with_planting.md`), every planted door MUST also carry the `specs/` bundle (RAPPID_SPEC, HOLOCARD_SPEC, ANTIPATTERNS, SOUL_IDENTITY, PARTICIPATION, AGENT_SPEC, RAPPLICATION_SPEC, SENSE_SPEC, the kind-specific protocol, and **ESTATE_SPEC** as of bundle v1.1.0).

---

## 3. The Estate Stores Only Rappid + Provenance

The user's **estate** is the door catalog — every door they own (`created`) plus every door they're a contributor in (`member`). It lives in two places:

- **Local source of truth:** `~/.brainstem/estate.json`
- **Public mirror (optional):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<github-handle>/rapp-estate/main/estate.json`

Per Article XLVI.3, each entry stores **only**:

```json
{
  "rappid": "rappid:@owner/repo:hex",
  "added_at": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z",
  "via": "created" | "scan" | "manual" | "import" | "published-by-other"
}
```

Everything else (owner, repo, kind, door_type, name, summon_url, holocard URL, all 9 canonical URLs) is **DERIVED** at read time via `door_from_rappid(rappid)`. There are no stored fallback fields. There are no patched URLs. If the rappid changes, every derived field updates. If the rappid is invalid, the entry surfaces as an error — never silently fixed up.

This is the constitutional answer to *"don't do all of these exception things."*

### 3.1 The full estate.json schema

```json
{
  "schema": "rapp-estate/1.1",
  "owner": {
    "rappid": "rappid:@<github>/<their-twin-or-brainstem>:hex",
    "github": "<github-handle>"
  },
  "created": [{ "rappid": "...", "added_at": "...", "via": "created" }],
  "member":  [{ "rappid": "...", "added_at": "...", "via": "scan" }],
  "updated_at": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z"
}
```

The `owner.rappid` is the operator's **personal** rappid — minted once at first install, lives at `~/.brainstem/rappid.json`. It is the universal anchor for both sides of the estate:

- **As ancestor** of `created[]`: every door the operator planted has `parent_rappid = owner.rappid` in its own `rappid.json`.
- **As member-proof** for `member[]`: every gate the operator joined lists `owner.rappid` in its own `members.json`.

The same identity, two roles. No additional ID system needed.

---

## 4. Discovery Is Pure Raw Fetch

A consumer MUST be able to discover any door, and any user's full estate, with `curl` alone. No `gh` CLI, no API token, no rate limit (for public repos), no auth.

### 4.1 Discover one door from its rappid

```bash
# From the rappid, parse <owner>/<repo>:
RAPPID='rappid:@kody-w/echo-brainstem:abc...'
OWNER_REPO=$(echo "$RAPPID" | sed 's|.*:@\([^:]*\):.*|\1|')

# Fetch identity, holocard, holo.md, etc.:
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/rappid.json"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/card.json"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/holo.md"
```

### 4.2 Discover a user's full estate from their GitHub handle

```bash
# A single roundtrip, no auth, no API:
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<github-handle>/rapp-estate/main/estate.json"
```

This returns the full door catalog. From there, every entry's rappid expands to the door's own URL set via `door_from_rappid()`.

### 4.3 The chain rule

To enumerate every door in a user's reach: fetch their estate → for each entry's rappid, fetch the door's `rappid.json` → if you want to walk into a gate's membership, fetch its `members.json` → each member's rappid expands to their estate URL. Federation is a graph walk over pure raw fetches.

---

## 5. The `door_from_rappid` Derivation Contract

Every consumer that maps rappid → door URLs MUST use a function with this contract:

```python
def door_from_rappid(rappid: str) -> dict:
    """Return the canonical door object for a rappid. Pure function.

    Returns:
      {
        "rappid": str,
        "owner": str,
        "repo": str,
        "kind": str,
        "door_type": "front_door" | "gate",
        "urls": {
          "repo": "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>",
          "front": "https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/",
          "identity": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/rappid.json",
          "holocard": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/card.json",
          "holo_md": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo.md",
          "avatar": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo.svg",
          "summon_qr": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/holo-qr.svg",
          "members": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/members.json",  # gates only
          "facets": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/facets.json"
        }
      }

    Raises:
      InvalidRappidError only if the string is genuinely malformed (no parseable
      @<owner>/<slug>:<hash> and no canonicalizable legacy form). It MUST ACCEPT
      the consolidated Eternity form `rappid:@<owner>/<slug>:<64hex>` (one
      location segment) and MUST canonicalize every legacy form on read (v2
      `rappid:v2:<kind>:@<owner>/<repo>:<32hex>@github.com/...`, bare UUID, bare
      `rappid:<slug>:<64hex>`) via `canonicalize_rappid()` before deriving — it
      MUST NOT reject a rappid merely for "not being v2".
    """
```

> **Amendment (2026-07-08, per CONSTITUTION Art. XXXIV.1 lock 2026-06-03).** An
> earlier draft of this Raises clause read "*if the string is not a valid v2
> rappid OR if the `<owner>/<repo>` appears differently in the two segments*."
> That is superseded: the canonical consolidated Eternity form has ONE
> `@<owner>/<slug>` segment (not two) and is not a "v2 rappid", so the old clause
> would reject every currently-mintable rappid. The contract now validates the
> Eternity form and read-forever-canonicalizes legacy v2 (never emitting it),
> matching the reference `tools/door_address.py` (`parse_rappid` /
> `canonicalize_rappid`). Identity is `rapp-eternity/1.0` — the sole identity
> standard, to which `rapp-rappid/2.0` defers.

Implementation lives at `tools/door_address.py`. Imported by `plant_seed_agent.py`, `estate_agent.py`, and any future federation/discovery consumer. One implementation, one contract — no per-consumer reinventions.

## 6. Disaster Recovery — The Estate Is Recomputable

The estate file is a **cache** of relationships the network already publishes. Both copies (`~/.brainstem/estate.json` locally and `<handle>/rapp-estate/main/estate.json` publicly) can be reconstructed from scratch given just the operator's GitHub handle. **This is the load-bearing property the spec exists to guarantee.** If both caches are gone, the rebuild walks public data and produces an identical estate.

### 6.1 The two relationships, both publicly visible

- **Created** — every door the operator planted has its `rappid.json` carry `parent_rappid = <operator-rappid>`. Discovery: walk `<handle>/*` repos, fetch each `rappid.json`, filter on `parent_rappid` matching the operator.
- **Member** — every gate the operator joined lists their rappid in `members.json`. Discovery: search public GitHub for any `members.json` containing the operator's rappid string.

### 6.2 The rebuild procedure

```bash
python3 tools/rebuild_estate.py --handle <gh>            # dry-run, prints
python3 tools/rebuild_estate.py --handle <gh> --apply    # writes ~/.brainstem/estate.json
```

Pseudo-code:

```python
def rebuild(handle):
    operator_rappid = discover_operator(handle)            # § 6.3
    created = []
    for repo in gh_repo_list(handle):
        rappid_meta = raw_fetch(handle, repo, "rappid.json")
        if rappid_meta and rappid_meta["parent_rappid"] == operator_rappid:
            created.append({"rappid": rappid_meta["rappid"], "added_at": now(), "via": "rebuild"})
    member = []
    for hit in gh_search_code(operator_rappid, filename="members.json"):
        gate = raw_fetch_rappid_json(hit.repo)
        member.append({"rappid": gate["rappid"], "added_at": now(), "via": "rebuild"})
    return {"schema": "rapp-estate/1.1", "owner": {...}, "created": created, "member": member}
```

### 6.3 Operator-rappid discovery

The rebuild needs to know the operator's personal rappid before it can filter `parent_rappid` matches. Discovery order:

1. **Local** — `~/.brainstem/rappid.json` (fast path when the operator runs the rebuild on their own machine).
2. **Conventional repos** — `<handle>/<handle>-twin`, `<handle>/<handle>-brainstem`, `<handle>/.brainstem`, plus operator-specific anchors. If any has a valid rappid, derive the operator rappid by ensuring `kind` is `operator` (swap from `twin` if necessary; same owner/repo/hex).
3. **Repo scan** — walk `<handle>/*` for any `rappid.json` with `kind=operator` or `kind=twin` matching the conventional pattern.
4. **Operator hint** — if all automatic discovery fails, the operator passes `--operator-rappid <rappid>` explicitly.

### 6.4 The constitutional invariant

Per Article XLVI.6:
- Every planted door's `rappid.json` MUST set `parent_rappid` to the planter's personal rappid (NOT to None, NOT to the species root). The planter (`plant_seed_agent.py`) enforces this on every new plant; `tools/backfill_seeds.py --patch-parents <op-rappid>` brings older plantings into compliance.
- The rebuild tool is operator-tooling, but the **property** it proves is load-bearing: relationships are knowable from public data. Losing local state is recoverable.

### 6.5 What this enables

- **Disaster recovery**: laptop dies, no backup → the estate rebuilds from any other device with `gh` auth.
- **Drop-in rappid lookup**: pass any rappid to `estate fetch rappid=<rappid>` → the agent parses, traces `parent_rappid` if needed, and fetches whoever owns that door's published estate. No local state required.
- **Federation auditing**: anyone can verify a published estate's claims by running the rebuild for the same handle and comparing results.

---

## 7. Adoption + Compliance

- **All NEW plantings** (after this spec ships) emit the full Door URL Set. No exceptions.
- **All EXISTING plantings** are backfilled by `tools/backfill_seeds.py` — runnable any time, idempotent. The script downloads each known seed's `rappid.json`, validates it against the spec, and PUTs the missing canonical files. It is the operator's responsibility to run it for plantings created before 2026-05-09.
- **Stale rappids** (where the `<owner>/<repo>` doesn't match the actual hosting URL) are rejected by `door_from_rappid()` and reissued by the backfill script (the historical `sim-art-collective` case is the canonical example).

---

## 7.5 Neighborhood-scale estate (federation as a first-class scale)

> **Schema anchor:** `rapp-egg/2.0` declares `scale` ∈ {`agent`, `twin`, `brainstem`, `neighborhood`, `swarm`, `factory`, `industry`, `estate`}. Sections 7.5–7.7 cover the two scales above the single-twin door — **neighborhood** and **estate** — and the cartridge form each takes.

The estate model up through §7 assumes a single operator anchoring a catalog of single-twin doors. That stays true for the common case. But the rappid-as-URL property scales: any door that has its own rappid can itself be a *gate* whose `members.json` enumerates rappids of constituent doors. When a gate's members are themselves twins (rather than humans), the gate IS a federation, and the federation IS a door.

### 7.5.1 The neighborhood as an estate

A **neighborhood-scale estate** is an estate whose `created[]` and `member[]` are populated with rappids of *twin federations* rather than (or in addition to) single twins. The four-twin AIBAST deployment (Heimdall + @kody-w + Bots in Blazers + AIBAST, see [[The Federated Twin Egg Hatcher Pattern]]) is the canonical example: four twins, one neighborhood-rappid, one operator estate that references the neighborhood-rappid as a single entry whose URLs resolve to a `members.json` enumerating the four.

The door-type derivation in §1 still holds: a rappid with `kind = "neighborhood"` resolves to `door_type = "gate"` (XLVI.2), and the canonical Door URL Set in §2 already requires gates to publish `members.json`. The neighborhood-scale extension is operational, not schema-breaking:

- **`members.json` carries twin rappids.** Each entry is `{rappid, port_hint, joined_at, via}`. The `port_hint` is the integer port the member should boot on (7081–7084 for the AIBAST four-twin), used by the hatcher to assign listening sockets on the destination host. `via` records how the member joined: `seed` (hatched from the same cartridge), `invite` (cross-signed in), or `import` (imported from another federation).
- **`facets.json` advertises federation capabilities.** A neighborhood gate's facets MUST include `federation` (with members count) and SHOULD include `mesh_chat` (cross-twin fan-out) and `boot_all` (idempotent boot of every member's child brainstem). Consumers reading facets can tell at a glance "this is a four-twin federation that supports mesh chat" without unpacking any cartridge.
- **The 9 canonical URLs are unchanged.** A neighborhood gate publishes the same Door URL Set as any other gate. `members.json` is the only field whose semantics extend (from "humans who joined" to "twin rappids that compose the federation"); the file path, schema name (`rapp-neighborhood-members/1.0`), and discovery protocol are identical.

### 7.5.2 The federation cartridge — `rapp-egg/2.0` with `scale: neighborhood`

When a neighborhood is exported as a portable cartridge, it ships as the `rapp-egg/2.0` shape described in [[NEIGHBORHOOD_PROTOCOL]] §5e. The manifest declares `scale: neighborhood`; the zip carries each member's workspace under `twins/<hash>/` plus a top-level `members.json` mirroring `manifest.json::members[]`. Hatching unpacks each `twins/<hash>/` into `~/.rapp/twins/<hash>/` on the destination host and writes the neighborhood roster + the cartridge's own rappid to `~/.rapp/neighborhoods/<neighborhood_hash>/` for future `Neighborhood.boot_all` and `Twin.list` consumers.

The canonical hatcher is `@kody/twin_egg_hatcher` v1.1.0 (distributed via RAR PR #98). It dispatches per `scale`: `twin` lands at `~/.rapp/twins/<hash>/`, `neighborhood` lands BOTH `~/.rapp/twins/<hash>/` per member AND `~/.rapp/neighborhoods/<hash>/` for the roster, and container scales (`swarm` / `factory` / `industry` / `estate`) currently land at `~/.rapp/<scale>s/<hash>/` as best-effort scaffolding pending scale-specific handlers. The hatcher's introspection rule is: read `manifest.scale`, dispatch; if `scale` is unknown, refuse (no silent fallback).

### 7.5.3 The four-twin worked example

The first neighborhood-scale federation that shipped is the AIBAST deployment:

| Port | Twin              | Member rappid kind | Source     |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 7081 | Heimdall          | `personal`         | public repo |
| 7082 | @kody-w           | `operator`         | public repo |
| 7083 | Bots in Blazers   | `project`          | private repo |
| 7084 | AIBAST            | `project`          | `.egg` file |

All four were hatched from a single cartridge — `aibast-federation.egg`, 19,903 bytes — that bundled each twin's `rappid.json` + `soul.md` + `agents/` + `.brainstem_data/`. The cartridge's manifest declared `scale: neighborhood` at the `rapp-egg/2.0` level, with `members[]` enumerating four entries. The cartridge is the federation in suspended animation: hatching it on a fresh laptop produces byte-for-byte the same four-twin conversation surface that ran on the source. Memories travel with the cartridge by design (`.brainstem_data/` is included).

---

## 7.6 Estate cartridges — substrate-portable identity (`brainstem-egg/2.3-estate`)

The neighborhood cartridge above moves *one federation*. The **estate cartridge** moves the *whole operator identity* — every door the operator created, every gate they're a member of, every cross-signed device, every memory layer — across substrates in one motion.

### 7.6.1 Schema and family

The estate cartridge is the `brainstem-egg/2.3-estate` member of the egg family table in [SPEC.md §18.10](./SPEC.md). At the `rapp-egg/2.0` level it declares `scale: estate`. The two schema names coexist: `rapp-egg/2.0` is the universal cartridge envelope (any scale); `brainstem-egg/2.3-estate` is the family-table name for the estate-scale instance of that envelope. Producers MUST emit both fields in `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "brainstem-egg/2.3-estate",
  "scale":  "estate",
  "rapp_egg_version": "2.0",
  "owner_rappid": "rappid:@<gh>/<their-brainstem>:hex",
  "estate_snapshot_at": "<iso8601>",
  "members": [ /* see 7.6.2 */ ]
}
```

### 7.6.2 Layout — nested cartridges

The estate cartridge's `members[]` are not flat twins — they are *themselves cartridges*, one per door in the operator's catalog. A typical estate cartridge layout:

```
manifest.json                                  # scale: estate, members: [...]
estate.json                                    # the full rapp-estate/1.1 catalog
owner_rappid.json                              # operator's personal rappid
members/
    <neighborhood-hash>/                       # nested neighborhood cartridge
        manifest.json                          # scale: neighborhood
        members.json
        twins/<hash>/...
    <twin-hash>/                               # nested single-twin cartridge
        manifest.json                          # scale: twin
        rappid.json
        soul.md
        agents/*.py
        .brainstem_data/
    ...
README.md                                      # human-readable cartridge inventory
```

Each `members/<hash>/manifest.json` is a complete, independently-hatchable cartridge. An operator can extract one nested cartridge and hatch it standalone; the estate hatcher just iterates `members[]` and recursively dispatches the existing per-scale hatchers (`scale: twin` → twin handler, `scale: neighborhood` → neighborhood handler).

### 7.6.3 Substrate migration

The estate cartridge is the **substrate-portable identity primitive**. Workflow:

1. **Export.** On the source brainstem, `EstateExport(action="cartridge")` walks `~/.brainstem/estate.json`, collects each referenced door's local workspace (or fetches it from the canonical URL set if absent locally), and zips the lot with the estate-scale manifest at root.
2. **Migrate.** AirDrop / sneakernet / file-fetch the `.egg` to the destination. The cartridge is opaque on the wire — no DNS, no GitHub Pages, no PeerJS broker required.
3. **Re-anchor.** On the destination, `egg_hatcher_agent.py` reads `manifest.scale = estate`, recursively hatches each `members/<hash>/` per its own scale, restores `~/.brainstem/estate.json` from the bundled copy, and verifies that every member's `parent_rappid` still resolves through `owner_rappid`. **No re-cross-signing required** — rappids stay intact across the move; the cross-signing chain in each member's `.brainstem_data/` is part of the payload.

The substrate dimension is orthogonal to the addressing dimension. §6.5 already declares that the rappid-as-URL property works across GitHub Raw, LAN HTTP, AirDrop'd eggs, and `file://` sneakernet. The estate cartridge generalizes that: not just a single door's URLs, but the *whole catalog* and *every member's body* is substrate-agnostic.

### 7.6.4 Properties this guarantees

- **Identity portability.** An operator's whole digital identity (every twin, every federation, every memory) is one `.egg`. Lose the laptop, hatch the egg on a new one, federation resumes.
- **Cross-substrate disaster recovery.** If GitHub is unreachable, the estate cartridge is the source of truth. Combined with §6 (the estate is recomputable from public data), the operator has two independent recovery paths.
- **Offline-first federation handoff.** Two operators meeting in person can AirDrop estate cartridges with no network round-trip. The receiving brainstem becomes a temporary mirror of the sender's whole identity, gated by which subset the recipient chooses to actually hatch.

### 7.6.5 Cartridge integrity and provenance

Estate cartridges carry the same `provenance.file_hashes` + `manifest_hash` envelope as the organism eggs described in [`ECOSYSTEM.md`](../../ECOSYSTEM.md) §9. The verifier recomputes per-file SHA-256s, the manifest hash, and the recursive integrity of each nested member cartridge. A tampered estate is detectable client-side without any network call. The owner's M-key signature (per [[The Swarm Estate]] §"Cross-signing hierarchy") MAY be appended to the manifest as `owner_signature`; verifiers SHOULD check it when present but MUST NOT require it (the cartridge's own cross-signing chains inside each member are the authoritative key material).

## 6.5 Substrate-Agnostic Federation (Article XLVII.5)

This spec defines the rappid as the global address. **What URL substrate that address is fetched over** is a separate concern, covered in [`SUBSTRATE_FEDERATION.md`](./SUBSTRATE_FEDERATION.md). The four substrates — GitHub raw, LAN HTTP + Bonjour, AirDrop'd egg cartridges, sneakernet `file://` — all serve the same rappid-keyed JSON. The estate spec applies uniformly across all of them.

The TL;DR: an operator's estate.json + beacon are reachable via:

- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<handle>/rapp-estate/main/...` (default)
- `http://<lan-ip>:8080/...` (LAN, via `tools/lan_advertise.py`)
- AirDrop'd `.egg` extracted to a peer's machine (the egg bundles the federation tools)
- `file://...` URLs from sneakernet-imported eggs (`tools/import_peer_egg.py`)

The sniffer (`tools/sniff_network.py`) walks all four substrates uniformly. Authority for the substrate model: SUBSTRATE_FEDERATION.md + CONSTITUTION Article XLVII.

## 7. Public/Private Boundary (Article XLVIII)

**The two-tier estate is mandatory from first install.** Discovery is public (this spec); substance is private. Every operator gets BOTH `<handle>/rapp-estate` (public) AND `<handle>/rapp-estate-private` (private GitHub repo). The public beacon's `private_estate_pointer` + `private_estate_commitment` + `private_door_count` (REQUIRED in `rapp-network-beacon/1.1`) advertise the existence and integrity of private state without leaking what it contains. URLs inside the private repo are opaque (Article XLVIII.6) so even a 404 reveals nothing.

Authority: [`pages/docs/PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md`](./PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md). Constitutional anchor: CONSTITUTION Article XLVIII (6 subsections). Conformance: `tests/features/F15-private-estate.sh` (10 steps).

> **Serving-surface note (2026-07-08).** The estate / plant / hatch capabilities are canonically driven as **actions on the one agent** (`@rapp/rapp` — e.g. `estate`, `door`, `whoami`, `hatch`) plus RAR-distributed specialists, not as standalone kernel files at fixed paths. Two hatcher layers coexist (per `pages/docs/SPEC.md` §18.10 / `ECOSYSTEM.md` §15.5): the kernel `.egg` **kind**-router `egg_hatcher_agent.py` and the `rapp-egg/2.0` **scale**-dispatcher `@kody/twin_egg_hatcher` (`twin_egg_hatcher_agent.py`, RAR PR #98, the canonical hatcher per §7.5.2) — an additive superset, not a competitor. Treat the `*_agent.py` filenames above as role labels; resolve the live serving agent through RAR / the one-agent action surface.
