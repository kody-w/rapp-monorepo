# RAR — RAPP Agent Registry

> **Spec:** `rapp-registry/1.0` — the canonical agent registry + minting authority (peer to RAPP_Store/RAPP_Sense_Store).

**The open single-file agent ecosystem.** Browse, build, collect, and share AI agents. Every agent is one `.py` file.

180 agents. 8 publishers. 24 categories. 1,144 tests. Every card has a seed.

**RAPP + X™** is the headless collaboration pattern behind the ecosystem:
`X` may be a person, AI, twin, rapplication, Brainstem, or neighborhood peer.
Everyone uses the same `/chat`-shaped capability contract; UI is always an
optional client, never a requirement.

See [`TRADEMARKS.md`](TRADEMARKS.md) for the mark definition, correct `™`
usage, public first-use evidence, and legal-registration handoff.

**[Install Brainstem](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-installer)** | **[Try vSandbox](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/virtual-brainstem.html)** | **[Agent Store](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/)** | **[FAQ](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/faq.html)** | **[Whitepaper](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/whitepaper.html)**

> **Need a bundled rapplication** (agent + UI / service / state) **rather than a single file?** Browse **[kody-w/RAPP_Store](https://kody-w.github.io/RAPP_Store/)** — the catalog of packaged rapplications. Per [Constitution Article XXVII](https://github.com/kody-w/RAPP/blob/main/CONSTITUTION.md#article-xxvii--rar-holds-files-the-rapp-store-holds-bundles): bare agents live here in RAR; bundles live in the rapp store.

---

## Submit an Agent (one command)

```bash
# Get the SDK
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/rapp_sdk.py

# Write your agent
python rapp_sdk.py new @yourname/my_cool_agent

# Submit
python rapp_sdk.py submit agents/@yourname/my_cool_agent.py
```

That's it. The SDK creates a versioned GitHub Issue command. RAR records the
authenticated GitHub identity, stages the exact source hash, and binds approval
to that immutable revision. Hashes use `sha256-lf-v1`: UTF-8 with CRLF replaced
by LF and no other normalization. Successful checks produce a receipt committed to
`main`; the forge then mints the card.

**Update an agent:** bump the version in `__manifest__` and submit again.

---

## What is this?

RAPP is npm for AI agents — but local-first, single-file, and offline-capable. No `node_modules`. No build step. No server.

- **Every agent is one `.py` file** — the file IS the package, the manifest, and the documentation
- **Every card has a seed** — a 64-bit number that reconstructs the full card offline, anywhere
- **Every seed has an incantation** — 7 words that summon the card: `TWIST MOLD BEQUEST VALOR LEFT ORBIT RUNE`
- **`git clone` = you have everything** — works from `file://`, no internet required

Read **[The Ode](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/ode.html)** for why single-file agents are the only pattern that scales to all of humanity.

## The Agent Store

The store (`index.html`) is a single HTML file. Open it in any browser.

- **Browse** — search 180 agents across 24 categories, filter by tier, sort by votes
- **Cards** — every agent is a collectible card with types, stats, abilities, and art
- **Decks** — collect agents into named decks, present as slideshows
- **Workbench** — write agents in the browser, validate, preview as card
- **Submit** — publish through the UI or the SDK

## The SDK

`rapp_sdk.py` — zero dependencies, one file.

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `new @pub/slug` | Scaffold agent from template |
| `validate path.py` | Validate manifest |
| `test path.py` | Run contract tests |
| `submit path.py` | Submit to RAPP |
| `delete @pub/slug --reason "..."` | Request hash-bound deletion |
| `request-read @pub/slug` | Create an auditable read Issue |
| `request-status ISSUE` | Read the Issues-backed lifecycle |
| `card resolve NAME` | Resolve card from name, seed number, or 7-word incantation |
| `card words NAME` | Get the 7-word incantation for any agent |
| `egg forge @a @b @c` | Compress agents to a shareable string |
| `egg hatch STRING` | Reconstruct agents from compact string |

All commands support `--json`.

## Card Type System

7 agent types, deterministic from manifest data:

| Type | Color | Weak to | Resists |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| LOGIC | Blue | Wealth | Data |
| DATA | Green | Logic | Social |
| SOCIAL | Yellow | Data | Shield |
| SHIELD | White | Social | Craft |
| CRAFT | Red | Shield | Heal |
| HEAL | Pink | Craft | Wealth |
| WEALTH | Purple | Heal | Logic |

Cards have HP, ATK/DEF/SPD/INT stats, 1-3 abilities with cost and damage, weakness/resistance, retreat cost, and evolution stage (Seed → Base → Evolved → Legendary).

---

## The Seed Protocol

Every card has a 64-bit seed forged from the agent's manifest. The seed IS the card's DNA.

```
manifest → forge_seed() → resolve_card_from_seed() = the card
```

Three ways to resolve a card:
- **From file:** `python rapp_sdk.py card mint agent.py`
- **From name:** `python rapp_sdk.py card resolve @kody-w/deal_desk_agent`
- **From seed:** `python rapp_sdk.py card resolve 3736335358696106227`
- **From incantation:** `python rapp_sdk.py card resolve TWIST MOLD BEQUEST VALOR LEFT ORBIT RUNE`

All four produce the same card. Lossless. Offline. Permanent.

## Run RAR headless

RAR is consumable as a static, read-only API. Every endpoint is a plain JSON
file on a CDN — no server, no key, no rate limit, CORS open to everyone. This is
how host applications embed the registry without sending anyone to GitHub.

Start at **[manifest.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/manifest.json)**;
it names every other endpoint, so one URL is the only thing worth hardcoding.

| Endpoint | What it is for |
|----------|----------------|
| `manifest.json` | Discovery root. Start here. |
| `api/v1/catalog.json` | Every agent as a lean record — one fetch renders a whole catalog |
| `api/v1/audience/business.json` | Pre-curated enterprise slice, safe to surface unfiltered |
| `api/v1/audience/consumer.json` | Pre-curated individual slice |
| `api/v1/audience/map.json` | Just the audience verdict per agent (~14KB) if you already hold the catalog |
| `api/v1/match.json` | Use case → ranked agents, plus a term index for free-text search you run client-side |
| `api/v1/taxonomy.json` | Categories, tags and publishers with counts |
| `api/v1/status.json` | Content hashes per endpoint, for cheap change detection |

```bash
# The curated enterprise catalog, ready to render
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/api/v1/audience/business.json

# Installing an agent is one request — the response body is the whole package
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/agents/@rapp/drift_agent.py
```

**[discover.html](https://kody-w.github.io/RAR/discover.html)** is this API with a
face on it: search, recommend and copy an install command without a GitHub
account. It is the reference implementation for embedding RAR elsewhere.

Those agent URLs are permanent. See
[Article XXIII](CONSTITUTION.md#article-xxiii--the-permanent-url-contract) — a
published agent path is a public contract and is never renamed, moved or
deleted. `scripts/check_url_stability.py` enforces it in CI on every push.

For how RAR answers specific enterprise-adoption requirements — consumption,
trust, curation, integration, economics — see
**[docs/FIELD-REQUIREMENTS.md](docs/FIELD-REQUIREMENTS.md)**, which states what is
solved, what is partly solved, and what is deliberately not claimed.

## For AI Agents

Read **[api.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/api.json)** —
the machine-readable API manifest. Create, read, update, delete, restore, and
inspect requests through the same GitHub Issues surface used by humans. No UI
or human proxy is required.

Read **[skill.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAR/main/skill.md)** — the full skill interface for autonomous agent operations.

## Quality Tiers

| Tier | Card Stage | Meaning |
|------|------------|---------|
| `experimental` | Seed | Author says it works |
| `community` | Base | Passes automated validation (default) |
| `verified` | Evolved | Reviewed by maintainer |
| `official` | Legendary | Core team maintained |

## Publishers

| Publisher | Agents | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **@aibast-agents-library** | 104 | Industry vertical templates (14 verticals) |
| **@kody-w** | 27 | Core infrastructure, registry, engine, Rappterpedia |
| **@rapp** | 21 | BasicAgent base class, core platform agents |
| **@discreetRappers** | 13 | Pipeline, integrations, sales, productivity |

## Federation

RAPP is a GitHub template repo. Clone it → your own registry + agents/ collection + GitHub Pages.

```bash
python scripts/federate.py status    # check federation config
python scripts/federate.py submit    # submit agents upstream
python scripts/federate.py sync      # pull from upstream
```
