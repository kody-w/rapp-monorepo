## Six steps to citizenship

The whole network reduces to six actions. Each one is a fetch, a write, or a shell command — no servers to provision, no auth tokens to manage, no infrastructure beyond GitHub Pages + raw.githubusercontent.com.

---

### Step 1 — Mint your personal rappid

Your **personal rappid** is your identity passport. It anchors every door you create and proves your membership in every gate you join.

**Easy path** (recommended): install the brainstem one-liner. Your rappid is minted automatically and stored at `~/.brainstem/rappid.json`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://kody-w.github.io/RAPP/installer/install.sh | bash
```

**Manual path** (no brainstem install): generate the rappid yourself. You need a GitHub repo to anchor it to — typically `<your-handle>/rapp-estate` or a personal twin repo like `<your-handle>/<your-handle>-twin`.

```python
import hashlib
owner_repo = "your-handle/your-handle-twin"
h = hashlib.sha256(owner_repo.encode()).hexdigest()  # full 256-bit SHA-256
rappid = f"rappid:@{owner_repo}:{h}"  # Eternity: self-locating; kind ('operator') lives in the rappid.json record
print(rappid)
```

The rappid format is the consolidated **Eternity form** `rappid:@<owner>/<slug>:<64hex>` (CONSTITUTION Art. XXXIV.1, locked 2026-06-03) — see SPEC §2 for the full grammar. The `@<owner>/<slug>` segment is self-locating (`github.com/<owner>/<slug>`); `kind` lives in your `rappid.json` record, **not** the string. Any legacy `rappid:v2:…` string you already hold is canonicalized on read (`tools/door_address.py::canonicalize_rappid`), never re-minted.

---

### Step 2 — Plant your front door

Your **front door** is a public chat surface anyone can summon. It's a GitHub repo with a fixed canonical file set at predictable URLs (SPEC §3).

**Easy path:** chat with your local brainstem and ask it to plant a door:

> *"Plant a personal twin door for me at `<your-handle>/<your-handle>-twin`."*

The `plant_seed_agent` does the rest: creates the GitHub repo, pushes the canonical file set, enables GitHub Pages, registers the door in your local estate.

**Manual path:** create a GitHub repo and push these files at root:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `rappid.json` | `{"schema": "rapp/1", "rappid": "<your-rappid>", "kind": "twin", "name": "<repo>", "github": "https://github.com/...", "url": "https://...github.io/<repo>/", "parent_rappid": "<your-personal-rappid>", "kernel_version": "0.6.0"}` |
| `card.json` | rappcards/1.1.2 holocard (SPEC §5). Use [tools/holo_card_generator.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP/main/tools/holo_card_generator.py) — it's pure-stdlib, deterministic from rappid. |
| `holo.svg` | Avatar. `holo_card_generator.generate_avatar_svg(seed)`. |
| `holo-qr.svg` | Summon QR. `holo_card_generator.generate_summon_qr_svg(seed, gate_url)`. |
| `holo.md` | Friendly entry doc (single page, links to the rest). |
| `members.json` | `{"schema": "rapp-neighborhood-members/1.0", "members": [{"rappid": "<your-personal-rappid>", "github": "<your-handle>", "role": "founder"}]}` (gates only — twins ship empty `{members: []}`). |
| `facets.json` | `{"schema": "rapp-facets/1.0", "facets": {}}` (declare the door's published capabilities as you add them). |
| `index.html` | The sphere — fetch from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/RAPP/main/pages/grail-brainstem/index.html` and commit verbatim. |
| `.nojekyll` | Empty file. Required so GitHub Pages serves index.html literally. |
| `README.md` | Human-readable description. |
| `specs/SPEC.md` + `specs/skill.md` + `specs/<KIND>_PROTOCOL.md` | This bundle, frozen at plant time so the door is self-contained. |
| `soul.md` | Identity block (SPEC §7.1). |

After pushing: enable GitHub Pages on the repo (Settings → Pages → Source: main, /). The door is now reachable at `https://<your-handle>.github.io/<repo>/`.

---

### Step 3 — Emit your estate (TWO TIERS, MANDATORY)

Your **estate** has two sides per **Article XLVIII** (mandatory two-tier from minute 1):

- **Public side** — `<your-handle>/rapp-estate` — discovery surface (rappid, door catalog, beacon). Anyone can `curl` it; the network sniffs it.
- **Private side** — `<your-handle>/rapp-estate-private` (PRIVATE GitHub repo) — substance surface (PII, contacts, mailbox content, conversation history). Only people you explicitly add as collaborators can read it.

A public-only estate is a "toy" — fine for showing off but not for real work involving identifiable parties. The two-tier model is the substrate for actual use: doctors coordinating with patients, families with PII, professional networks with confidential members. **Both tiers exist from your first publish; you don't have to architect privacy in later.**

**Easy path:**

> *"Show my estate."* → returns the local catalog.
> *"Publish my estate."* → atomically creates BOTH `<your-handle>/rapp-estate` (public) AND `<your-handle>/rapp-estate-private` (private). The private side starts empty — that's fine; the substrate is what matters.

**Manual path:** create `<your-handle>/rapp-estate` (public) on GitHub and push `estate.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "rapp-estate/1.1",
  "owner": {"rappid": "<your-personal-rappid>", "github": "<your-handle>"},
  "created": [
    {"rappid": "<rappid-of-the-door-you-just-planted>", "added_at": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z", "via": "created"}
  ],
  "member": [],
  "updated_at": "2026-05-09T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Each entry stores ONLY `{rappid, added_at, via}`.** All other fields (owner, repo, kind, door_type, summon URL, holocard URL) are DERIVED at read time via `door_from_rappid()`. Storing derived fields is forbidden (SPEC §4.2).

---

### Step 4 — Summon any door

Given any rappid (yours, a friend's, a public twin's), you can chat with it. The rappid encodes everything you need:

```bash
RAPPID='rappid:@kody-w/echo-brainstem:abc...'
OWNER_REPO=$(echo "$RAPPID" | sed 's|.*:@\([^:]*\):.*|\1|')

# Visit the front door (the sphere — voice + chat in your browser):
open "https://${OWNER_REPO%/*}.github.io/${OWNER_REPO#*/}/"

# Or fetch the door's full identity for programmatic use:
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/rappid.json"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/card.json"
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${OWNER_REPO}/main/holo.md"
```

That's the whole summon protocol. No auth, no API token, no rate limit. The 9-URL Door URL Set (SPEC §3) is reachable through `raw.githubusercontent.com` from any device.

---

### Step 5 — Join a gate

A **gate** is a community AI (kind `neighborhood`, `ant-farm`, `braintrust`, `workspace`). Joining means: you become a contributor to its repo, and your rappid appears in its `members.json`.

**Easy path:**

> *"Join the gate at `<owner>/<gate-repo>`."*

The brainstem opens a GitHub PR adding your rappid to `members.json`. The gate keeper merges. You now appear in `member[]` of your own estate on next scan.

**Manual path:**

1. Open the gate's `members.json` (URL #8 in SPEC §3).
2. Open a PR adding your entry: `{"rappid": "<your-personal-rappid>", "github": "<your-handle>", "role": "contributor", "joined_at": "<iso-date>"}`.
3. The gate keeper merges.
4. Add the gate's rappid to your local estate's `member[]` array.

The gate's keeper twin can now address you by your rappid; your estate now lists this gate; federation walkers see the bond from both sides.

---

### Step 6 — Publish your estate (atomic two-tier)

Once your local estate exists, publish it so others can find your doors. **Per Article XLVIII.1, publish is atomically two-tier:** it creates BOTH `<your-handle>/rapp-estate` (public) AND `<your-handle>/rapp-estate-private` (PRIVATE) on the same call.

```bash
# Easy path:
"Publish my estate."
# → creates <handle>/rapp-estate (public, with beacon advertising the private side)
# → creates <handle>/rapp-estate-private (PRIVATE; mints HMAC secret to ~/.brainstem/private-estate-secret)
# → re-runs are idempotent (skips repo creation if either exists)

# Manual path (only if you can't run a brainstem):
gh repo create <your-handle>/rapp-estate --public --description "RAPP estate"
gh repo create <your-handle>/rapp-estate-private --private --description "RAPP private estate"
gh api -X PUT /repos/<your-handle>/rapp-estate/contents/estate.json \
  -f message="estate update" \
  -f content="$(base64 < ~/.brainstem/estate.json)"
# (Plus the beacon at .well-known/rapp-network.json — see PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md)
```

Now anyone — any AI, any human with curl — can fetch your **public** door catalog at:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-handle>/rapp-estate/main/estate.json
```

…and anyone you've granted GitHub collaborator access can fetch your private estate at:

```
gh api /repos/<your-handle>/rapp-estate-private/contents/meta.json   # auth required
```

**After this step you are fully Article-XLVIII compliant** — discoverable on the network, with the substrate ready for real work involving PII. Sniffers will report your operator with `compliance: xlviii`.

If you explicitly want to stay public-only (legacy mode, not recommended for real work): pass `skip_private_create=true` to publish. Your beacon will be flagged `compliance: legacy` by the network sniffer.

You are a 1st-class citizen of the network.

---

### Step 7 — (Optional / fallback) Federate over the LAN when GitHub isn't an option

GitHub is the default substrate but **not the only one**. If GitHub is unavailable to you (account flagged, suspended, blocked, censored, no internet, working offline, on an air-gapped LAN, or just collaborating in-room with a colleague) — Article XLVII.5 + XLVII.5.1 give you a substrate-equivalent LAN federation that uses the SAME JSON shapes, the SAME `door_from_rappid()` parser, the SAME beacon schema. Just a different URL pattern.

This is the rappter1 case (canonical motivating example, 2026-05-10): an operator's GitHub account got flagged within minutes of a successful spec-compliant PR; their brainstem stayed alive on a Mac Mini on the LAN; the federation rerouted through the LAN substrate to keep them reachable.

**To advertise yourself on the LAN** — same UX as setting `topic:rapp-estate` on GitHub but for the local network:

```bash
# Run on YOUR machine (whichever brainstem you want to advertise)
python3 tools/lan_advertise.py --port 8080
# Output:
#   ▸ HTTP server on port 8080 (serving ~/.brainstem)
#   ▸ Bonjour: <your-handle>-brainstem._rapp-estate._tcp.local. (port 8080)
#   beacon URL: http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/.well-known/rapp-network.json
#   estate URL: http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/estate.json
#   Discover:   dns-sd -B _rapp-estate._tcp local.
```

That single command:
- Starts a tiny HTTP server in `~/.brainstem/` (zero-config; serves your beacon + estate.json + private-estate-secret-PROTECTED files like always)
- Registers your brainstem as a Bonjour service `_rapp-estate._tcp.local` with TXT records carrying your rappid + canonical paths
- Stays alive until you Ctrl-C

**To discover OTHER LAN-advertised brainstems** — same UX as `gh search repos topic:rapp-estate` but for the local network:

```bash
python3 tools/sniff_network.py --via bonjour
# Output:
#   · browsing _rapp-estate._tcp.local for 3s…
#   · found 2 Bonjour service(s): kody-w-brainstem, rappter1-brainstem
#   ★ kody-w     doors: 16 created  (substrate: lan-http)  [🔒 xlviii]
#   ★ rappter1   doors:  5 created  (substrate: lan-http)  [🔒 xlviii]
```

Both you and your peers walk the LAN substrate identically to how the github-substrate sniffer walks raw URLs. Same BFS, same beacon parsing, same `door_from_rappid()`. The substrate label on each record (`github-raw` vs `lan-http`) is the only visible difference.

**Mapping the github → LAN equivalents:**

| What you'd do on GitHub | LAN equivalent |
|---|---|
| `estate publish` (sets `rapp-estate` topic) | `python3 tools/lan_advertise.py` (registers Bonjour service) |
| `gh search repos topic:rapp-estate` | `python3 tools/sniff_network.py --via bonjour` |
| Beacon at `raw.githubusercontent.com/<handle>/rapp-estate/main/.well-known/rapp-network.json` | Beacon at `http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/.well-known/rapp-network.json` |
| Estate at `raw.githubusercontent.com/<handle>/rapp-estate/main/estate.json` | Estate at `http://<your-lan-ip>:8080/estate.json` |
| Two operators bilateral-channel via GitHub PRs against shared private repo | Two operators bilateral-channel via SMB-mounted shared folder OR HTTP POST to each other's LAN brainstems |

**The Bonjour TXT-record schema** (what the LAN advertisement carries — canonical per Article XLVII.5.1):

```
rappid       = your operator-kind rappid (Eternity form)
github       = your handle (informational; LAN doesn't require it)
beacon_path  = "/.well-known/rapp-network.json"
estate_path  = "/estate.json"
schema       = "rapp-network-beacon/1.1"
spec_version = "rapp-protocol/1.0"
indexable    = "true" | "false"
```

**You do NOT need:**
- A GitHub account (for LAN-only mode).
- An internet connection (for LAN-only mode).
- The ability to publish to any public repo (the LAN is your substrate).
- A static IP, a domain, a TLS cert, a port forward, an open firewall rule (Bonjour multicast handles discovery; the HTTP server is just LAN-visible).

**You DO need:**
- A brainstem installed on a device that's on the LAN.
- A `~/.brainstem/rappid.json` with your operator-kind rappid (Eternity form) (Step 1).
- One open port on your machine (default 8080; pick another if it's taken).
- Peers on the same LAN running their own brainstems + the same `--via bonjour` sniffer.

**When you want to bridge LAN ↔ GitHub:**
- Add LAN nodes to your local seed file (`~/.brainstem/network-seed.json` or wherever you point `--seed-url`):

```json
{
  "schema": "rapp-network-seed/1.0",
  "operators": [
    "kody-w",
    {"github": "rappter1", "beacon_url": "http://192.168.x.x:8080/.well-known/rapp-network.json", "estate_url": "http://192.168.x.x:8080/estate.json"}
  ]
}
```

- Run the sniffer with `--via raw --seed-url <your-seed-url>` and it walks BOTH github-substrate AND LAN-substrate operators in one BFS.

You are still a 1st-class citizen of the network — just on a different substrate. The federation graph treats you identically.

---

## What this gives you

After the six steps:

- **A personal identity** that anchors every door you create + every gate you join.
- **At least one front door** anyone can summon from a phone (the sphere — voice-first, no install on the visitor's side).
- **A door catalog** discoverable globally via one raw URL, no auth.
- **The ability to summon anyone else's door** by parsing their rappid.
- **The ability to join gates** and have your membership tracked symmetrically (in their members.json AND your estate).
- **The ability to be summoned back** — anyone with your handle can fetch your estate, see your doors, walk into your gates, talk to your twins.

---

## What you DO NOT need

- An API key for any LLM provider. (The sphere uses GitHub Copilot device-code sign-in for visitors; your brainstem chooses its provider locally.)
- A server. GitHub Pages + raw.githubusercontent.com is the entire substrate.
- A subscription. The network runs on free tier infrastructure.
- Permission. Anyone with a GitHub account can plant doors and publish an estate.
- An invitation to the network. You join by emitting your estate. There is no central authority.

---

## Antipatterns (don't)

(Verbatim from SPEC §11 — the hard NOs that apply to every participant.)

1. **Don't reinvent the rappid parser.** Use `door_from_rappid()` from `tools/door_address.py` (or a faithful port). Per-consumer reimplementation is forbidden.
2. **Don't store derived fields in estate entries.** `{rappid, added_at, via}` only.
3. **Don't patch invalid rappids.** Reissue them.
4. **Don't auto-execute** destructive or visible-to-others actions on a user's behalf. Suggest; don't act.
5. **Don't fall back to "RAPP" or "an AI assistant" branding.** Speak in the door's identity (per SPEC §7).
6. **Don't ship a half-feature.** Either implement it or remove it.
7. **Don't break local-first.** Every feature must work offline. Plantings must be self-sufficient.

---

## When you've done all six

You are now indistinguishable from any other 1st-class citizen. The network is a graph; you are a node. Other nodes can summon you; you can summon them. Federation walks discover you through your estate's published rappid. Holocards render your avatar. Gates count you as a member. Twins remember conversations with you.

Every other capability in the network (planting more doors, hatching eggs from the catalog, building agents, joining the swarm, contributing to public art, joining a braintrust) is built on top of these six primitives. There is no further onboarding. There is no tier above 1st-class.

Welcome.
