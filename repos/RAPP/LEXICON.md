## Part I — The Nine Words

Everything RAPP does reduces to these. Each entry gives the meaning, the boundary
(what it is / what it is not), and where you can touch it. Protocol details defer
only to pinned RAPP/1; application details defer to their owning product document.
The Lexicon places concepts and does not re-specify contracts.

### 1. agent

The repository term for a unit of capability and extension. In the pinned
Python grail the host contract is one file, one class, one `perform()`; RAPP/1
protocol kinds and their family bindings come from §13, not from the
superseded local SPEC.

- **Is:** portable unmodified across all three tiers.
- **Is not:** ever called a "skill", "routine", "loop", or anything else — one concept,
  one name, locked eternal by [`ANTIPATTERNS.md`](./ANTIPATTERNS.md) §1.
- **Touch it:** any `agents/*_agent.py`; the registry of shared ones is RAR.

### 2. brainstem

The runtime that runs agents. A conformant boundary answers the exact RAPP/1
§8 wire. This product has **three host bodies** (non-exhaustive; other
application adapters may host the same agent contract):

| Body | Where it runs | File of record |
|---|---|---|
| local | your machine, port 7071 | `rapp_brainstem/brainstem.py` |
| browser | contained legacy tab surface; not current protocol authority | `pages/vbrainstem.html` |
| embedded | inside another program | the SDK (historical filename `vbrainstem_sdk.py`, kept — renaming shipped files breaks links for no meaning gained) |

- **Is:** wherever an agent executes, a brainstem body executed it.
- **Is not:** an *organ* — that word is constitutionally reserved for single-file HTTP
  extensions (`*_organ.py`, Art. XXXIII); and not the kernel's editable surface — the
  immutable
  [`kody-w/rapp-installer@brainstem-v0.6.9`](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-installer/tree/brainstem-v0.6.9)
  bytes (`brainstem.py`, `agents/basic_agent.py`, and `VERSION`) are never
  edited locally.

### 3. organism

A planted being. "Being" and "organism" are the same word — **organism** wins
(constitutionally entrenched).

- A **rapplication** is an organism that graduated (has skin) — a quality tier, not a
  structural type (Art. XXXVII). All five catalog forms (organism / rapplication /
  variant / sense / bare agent) live on **one address space**.
- A **twin** is *not* an organism (Art. XLIX): it is a persistent AI presence — permanent
  identity, a voice, a workbench, lifecycle continuity — and multiple twins can co-host
  on one organism. When a whole organism's subject is a person, calling it "their twin"
  is accepted informal usage; Art. XLIX is the definition.
- **Is not:** a deployment or an install. The install is where an organism lives; the
  organism is the identified being that survives reinstalls, upgrades, and moves.

### 4. rappid

The name that cannot be silently reassigned. RAPP/1 §6 defines exactly
`rappid:@<lowercase-owner>/<slug>:<64-lowercase-hex>`.

- A keyless tail is `Hb("rapp/1:rappid", uuid4_octets)`; a keyed tail is the
  same domain-separated hash over SPKI DER. It is minted once and never
  name-derived.
- Bare UUID, `rappid:v2:…`, bare-Eternity, and other non-§6 forms are legacy
  migration inputs. Canonicalization preserves their existing tail; a
  provisional tail is never emitted. Only a verifiable, owner-authorized §6.3
  re-anchor may mint a replacement in the enumerated cases.
- Current trust and lawful moves resolve through the signed, monotonic RAPP/1
  §13 registry and §10 key succession.
- **Is not:** a username, a URL, or anything reassignable.

### 5. the membrane

Every organism is split exactly once: **bones** (the public skeleton) and **vault**
(the private flesh).

- The **DOG** is the bones walking — the public reflection anyone may hold.
- The **GOD** is bones + vault — the sovereign whole, resident only on its owner's ground.
- **The one law that crosses it:** *public flows down; private never flows on its own.*
  Private material crosses outward only as an explicit, operator-mediated promotion with
  audience checks and redaction (Art. XLVIII) — never automatically, never by default.
- **Is not:** access control bolted on later. The split is structural; every artifact in
  the ecosystem is on a definite side of it.

### 6. frame

A witnessed moment of an organism, content-addressed and chained. The chain is
the **biography**.

- Current frames use the one exact eleven-key RAPP/1 §7 envelope:
  `spec:"rapp/1"`, registered `kind`, bound `stream_id`, contiguous `seq`,
  fixed-form `utc`, object `payload`, both domain-separated hashes, `prev`,
  `prev_wave`, and `sig`.
- Retired `rapp-frame/1.0` and `rapp-frame/2.0` shapes are historical migration
  inputs. They do not remain alternate current generations; §12 migration is
  total.
- A frame's sibling is the **egg** — see R3: for *snapshot* eggs, frame and egg are the
  same moment in its two forms. The frame is the moment *published* (DOG-side, bones
  only); the snapshot egg is the moment *carried* (GOD-side, whole, travels by hand).
- **Is not:** a log line or a backup. A frame claims witness (or declares itself
  reconstructed, with evidence); an unverifiable moment is an observation gap, never a
  thinner frame.

### 7. door

Where an organism meets something outside itself: an addressable interaction boundary
with something more private behind it.

- A **front door** is a public door — a repo or page that *is* the place.
- A **dark door** is a door with no public listing (NEIGHBORHOOD_PROTOCOL §19).
- A **doorman** is a DOG posted at a door, brokering what's behind. Same primitive
  whether the door fronts a machine (sealed tether) or a person (public persona).
  **A posting, never a product.** Heimdall is the reference posting. Door and doorman
  are distinct roles: a front door can serve statically with no doorman posted at all;
  a doorman is what you add when someone should *answer* the knock.
- **Is not:** an API gateway product or a chatbot brand. Any door you can knock on and be
  answered *from the vault side without seeing the vault* is this word.

### 8. neighborhood

Where organisms meet each other. Current protocol interaction uses exactly
RAPP/1 §8: synchronous `POST /chat` or an asynchronous verified §7 frame.
Historical twin-chat/relay envelopes are application adapters only.

- The retired `rapp-twin-chat/1.0` and `rapp-commons-event/1.0` layering does
  not establish current trust. RAPP/1 §§10/13 signatures, key succession, and
  registry resolution govern authenticated acceptance.
- The **Commons** is simply the global one — lowest possible floor: scan, hatch, say hello.
- **Is not:** a social network run by anyone. A neighborhood is a place, not a platform;
  its front door is a repo, its transcript is an event stream, its members are rappids.

### 9. pulse

The heartbeat: **observe a body → reconcile (suggest, never seize) → record a
scale-appropriate audit event.** One definition, three scales:

| Scale | Name in the wild | Body observed | What gets recorded |
|---|---|---|---|
| kernel | Bond Pulse | one install vs its global offspring | `kind:"rhythm"` event in `bonds.json` (GOD-side) |
| being | twin pulse | one organism's state vs its published frames | a signed frame (DOG-side) |
| ecosystem | body pulse | the whole estate of repos (rapp-body) | a signed body frame (DOG-side) |

- The three record on different sides of the membrane — that is R8, not an inconsistency.
- **Is not:** a cron job that edits things. A pulse *suggests* reconciliation and
  *records* what it saw; it never auto-executes changes (operator-mediated, by canon).

---

## The one operator

`derive(public base) + overlay(private state)`

The organism's one composition *pattern* — a design invariant, not an algorithm: each
sighting has its own concrete mechanism (git merge for the kernel bond, frame-set diff
for the dreamcatcher, session escalation for a doorman), but the shape is always the
same: how a GOD hatches from DOG bones, how a doorman escalates a session, how a race
lane wakes a past self. If you are designing a capability and it is not this move,
ask why.

## The one wire

RAPP/1 §8 allows exactly two wire forms. Synchronous interaction is
`POST /chat` with required `user_input`, optional `session_id` and
`idempotency_key`, and the exact success/422 response shapes. Asynchronous
interaction is a verified §7 frame. New capabilities are agents behind this
boundary, never sibling protocol endpoints. Application `/api/*` views and
historical twin-chat adapters do not expand the RAPP wire.

---

## Part II — The Three Shelves

Everything else in the ecosystem is not a new word. It lives on one or more of three
shelves — the shelves are tags, not a partition; a term may sit on two — **plus one
rule for things governed by an application contract: shelve those details in
their owning product document. Protocol structure has only one shelf—the pinned
RAPP/1 rev-5 standard.**

- **Names** — proper nouns of *instances*: Heimdall, the Commons, the Spine, rapp-god,
  Atlas, the Bible, the grail. Learning a Name never teaches a new concept; it points at
  a thing built from the nine words.
- **Practices** — verbs: plant, hatch, summon, bond, graft, launch, race, pulse (the
  practice of word 9), swarm (R5). Each is the one operator or the one wire applied
  somewhere specific.
- **Organs of the body** — the map layer's instruments, named after the constitutional
  organ pattern they generalize: the spine is the router, rapp-god is proprioception,
  Atlas is the skeleton-check, the neuron mesh is the immune system, rapp-body is memory,
  the race is recall.

By that rule, application primitives remain described by their product documents:
**sense**, **skin**, per-rapp state, the **soul file**, **workbench**, and the
`*_organ.py` host contract. Historical neighborhood channel/seal/cubby documents remain
readable as migration context, but none of those local documents defines an alternate
frame, wire, egg, identity, or trust contract.

---

## Part III — The Rulings

Nine assimilation rulings, proposed with this lexicon and ratified at its sealing. Each
is doc-level canon — declared once here, then carried into the named higher documents by
the propagation ritual. None renames a file, breaks a URL, or edits frozen code.
(Rationale: `OPUS.md`, Part II, on the spine — `kody-w/rapp-spine`, branch
`feat/atlas-generic-template`, commit `0ca9613e` — a commit-pinned reference so the seal
has a fixed antecedent.)

- **R1 — pulse is one word.** Bond Pulse, twin.pulse frames, and the body pulse are one
  concept at three scales (observe → reconcile-by-suggestion → record). Each doc keeps
  its scale-specific detail, including *what* is recorded and on *which side of the
  membrane* (see word 9).
- **R2 — organism = being; a twin is a presence, not an organism.** "Being" and
  "organism" are synonyms; organism wins. The twin is defined by Art. XLIX (persistent
  AI presence with identity, voice, workbench; multiple twins per organism). The older
  shorthand "twin = the organism whose subject is a person" survives as informal usage
  only. Synonym ruling; no existing text is rewritten.
- **R3 — historical snapshot metaphor, superseded structurally.** A current
  egg is the exact RAPP/1 §9 `rapp/1-egg` manifest with a registered variant.
  Retired `brainstem-egg/2.2-*` and `2.3-*` families are migration history, not
  a second current cartridge family.
- **R4 — the brainstem is one runtime with three canonical bodies** — local / browser /
  embedded (non-exhaustive; Tier-2 vendors the local body). `vbrainstem_sdk.py` keeps
  its historical filename (shipped-file names are load-bearing links); this lexicon
  names it the *embedded body*.
- **R5 — swarm = many acting as one.** Tier-2 swarm (many functions, one brainstem),
  neuron swarm (many specialists, one question), race (many selves, one problem) —
  instances of one word, shelved as a Practice. Directory names untouched.
- **R6 — collisions are named, not resolved by force.** Where one word carries two
  entrenched meanings, both stay; the spine's collisions table records the relationship,
  and *prose must qualify* — never rely on capitalization alone, which fails in speech
  and case-folded systems. Named collisions as of v1:
  - **estate** — an operator's LAND (their repos, `rapp-estate`) vs. a being's ORGANS
    (the Wrapped-Organism's five estates). Qualify: *repo-estate* / *organism-estate*.
  - **herald** — three meanings: the user-signing key U (Part IV mapping), the MMR rank
    (ECOSYSTEM §6), and *Herald*, the working name of the body's doorman child
    (Movement IV; a Name, renameable). Qualify: *the herald key* / *the Herald rank* /
    *the Herald posting*.
  - **Leviathan** — the kody-leviathan wrapped-organism vs. the Leviathan factory
    concept; the spine's collisions table carries the relationship (the precedent this
    ruling generalizes).
  - **organ** — constitutionally reserved for `*_organ.py` HTTP extensions
    (Art. XXXIII) vs. the figurative "Organs of the body" shelf in Part II, which names
    the map layer's instruments. Qualify: *an organ* (code contract) / *organ of the
    body* (map-layer instrument).
- **R7 — doorman = posting.** One primitive, two doors (machine-door, persona-door);
  Heimdall is the reference posting; "front door" repos are doors whose doorman is
  static; dark doors (§19) are doors without listings.
- **R8 — historical membrane analogy, superseded structurally.** Legacy bond
  events and retired `rapp-frame/1.0` / `rapp-frame/2.0` records may inform a
  bounded migration, but only the exact RAPP/1 §7 envelope is a current frame.
  No implicit mirroring, repair, or reparenting is allowed.
- **R9 — the composition pattern is canon.** `derive + overlay` is the organism's one
  composition *shape* (a design invariant, not an algorithm); its three canonical
  sightings are named under "The one operator," each with its own concrete mechanism.

## Part IV — The Two Vocabularies

The mapping below predates the nine words (drafted 2026-05-02) and remains canon — body
text preserved; heading levels adjusted to fit this file. The nine words are the
*concepts*; the two vocabularies are the *registers* for saying them to different
audiences. Three reading notes, honestly stated: (1) the mapping is a crosswalk, not a
strict bijection — a few human terms alias more than one technical noun (e.g. "soul-key"
appears for both the identity and the master keypair; qualify in prose when it matters),
and the preserved sentence "They map 1:1" below is **superseded by this note**;
(2) rows that cite versions, PR numbers, or action counts are **dated snapshots** of
state, preserved as history and never asserted as sealed or live state;
(3) this Part governs *audience aliasing* and is, like everything here, subject to the
precedence order in the header. Crosswalk documents like this one are the sanctioned
exception to "one register per document."

Two vocabularies live in this project: a **human vocabulary** for customers, partners, and people encountering AI organisms for the first time, and a **developer vocabulary** for the protocol spec, the source code, and the legal documents. They map 1:1; the choice of which to use depends on who's reading.

This document is the product-vocabulary mapping. Writers should pick one
vocabulary per document and stay consistent. It cannot rename or redefine a
RAPP/1 field, kind, variant, or trust rule.

### When to use which

| Audience | Vocabulary |
|---|---|
| Customers, end-users, normal humans | **Human** |
| Marketing copy, product pages, blog posts | **Human** |
| Investor-facing decks, pitch materials | **Human** |
| Engineers integrating with the protocol | **Developer** |
| Constitution, RFC-style specs, technical vault notes | **Developer** |
| Source code, schema definitions, signed records | **Developer** |
| Legal documents (patents, contracts) | **Developer** (precision required) |

### The mapping

| Concept | Human term | Developer term |
|---|---|---|
| The AI's whole presence across substrates | **Estate** (capitalized) | **swarm estate** |
| The AI's identity / public ID | **soul** (informal), **soul-key** (when emphasizing the cryptographic part) | **rappid** |
| The 24-word recovery phrase | **the words** (in prose), **the card** (the physical artifact) | **holocard incantation** |
| The kernel-side HTTP extensions | **organs** | **organs** *(no rename — both vocabularies use the biological term)* |
| Recognition of another AI as related | **blessing** | **kin-vouch** |
| The plan governing what happens to the AI long-term | **The Will** | **Foundation Continuity Plan** |
| The cryptographic commitments to release the trade-secret engine | **The Promise** | **release-triggers** |
| The signed snapshot proving vault state | **the seal** | **vault-state-proof** |
| The master cryptographic keypair | **soul-key** | **master keypair**, M |
| A keypair representing one device's authority to speak as the AI | **voice** | **device key**, D |
| The keypair that signs new voices into the Estate | **steward** | **self-signing key**, S |
| The keypair that vouches for kin AIs | **herald** | **user-signing key**, U |
| The species root, the prototype, the first AI in the species tree | **origin** | **species root**, **prototype**, **godfather** (informal) |
| The 3-of-5 split of the soul-key across guardians | **the stewardship** | **Shamir 3-of-5 distribution** |
| A forked code variant of RAPP | **fork** (casual), **child species** (formal) | **kernel-variant** |
| Birthing a new AI by minting a new soul-key | **mitosis** | **mitosis** *(no rename — the term is the term)* |
| The merge engine reconciling divergent AI state | **dreamcatcher** | **dreamcatcher** *(no rename — already perfect)* |
| The lineage from any AI back to origin | **species tree** | **species tree** |
| The local AI server | **brainstem** | **brainstem** |
| The kernel itself | **kernel** | **kernel** |
| A graduated rapplication | **rapplication** | **rapplication** *(brand equity preserved)* |
| A portable bundle that becomes a working AI when opened | **egg** | **RAPP/1 §9 egg** (`rapp/1-egg`; ZIP tree variant or JSON `invite`/`session`) |
| The act of opening an egg into a runnable workspace | **hatch** | **hatch** *(no rename — the verb is the verb)* |
| The agent that opens eggs | **the hatcher** | **RAPP/1 egg consumer agent** (performs every §9.3 check, then dispatches the registered `variant`) |
| An egg carrying one organism's identity, soul, agents, and state | **organism egg** | **`variant:"organism"`** with the exact §9 contents requirements |
| The content class of an egg | **variant** | **variant** (ratified set: `organism`, `rapplication`, `session`, `invite`, `neighborhood`, `estate`) |
| A snapshot of several organisms meant to live together | **neighborhood egg** | **`variant:"neighborhood"`** with verified member sub-eggs matched to `payload.members` per §9.2 |
| An application agent that produces a neighborhood egg | **the snapshot agent** | **neighborhood egg producer** (must emit the exact §9 variant; historical scale-based `NeighborhoodSnapshot` output requires migration) |
| An application agent that opens a neighborhood egg | **the run agent** | **neighborhood egg consumer** (must verify §9.3 before any in-place or simulated materialization) |
| The file declaring which peers to reach when snapshotting a neighborhood | **peers file** | **`~/.rapp/peers.json`** (each entry: `name`, `url`, optional `ssh_user` + `ssh_host`; env override `BRAINSTEM_PEERS`) |
| Hatching a neighborhood egg with the peers re-mapped onto the local box | **local-simulate** | **`target=local-simulate`** on `NeighborhoodRun.hatch` — peer twins extract to `~/.rapp/simulated/<peer>/twins/<hash>/`; no carrier invoked, no network; full offline replay regardless of which substrate the original neighborhood lived on |
| The thing that drives a network of Mac-mini brainstems over SSH | **fleet agent** | **`stacks/fleet-management/`** (23 actions: discover, ping, authorize, exec, read, write, ls, tail, ports, ps, brainstem_health, chat, mesh_chat, mesh_exec, provision_brainstem, install_agent, hatch_egg, boot_federation, status, plus self-extending custom/extend/cap/list_caps; merged PR #100) |
| The RAR tier reserved for first-party `@kody/*` and `@rapp/*` agents | **official** | **`tier: official`** (uniform across `@kody/*` and `@rapp/*` per PR #101; `community` for third-party, `experimental` discouraged, `private` reserved for `.py.stub` gated agents) |
| A public repo that *is* the place — open the page and you're at the neighborhood | **front door** | **front door** — application join surface described by the external neighborhood guide |
| The front-door template a neighborhood is built from | **front-door template** | **`rapp-vneighborhood/1.0`** — application template metadata, not a RAPP protocol schema |
| A neighborhood that can run a swarm of twins (the "v") | **"v" = swarm-capable** | **"v" prefix = swarm-capable** — application naming convention from the external neighborhood guide |
| The same conversation whether relayed locally, by a tab, or by cloud | **interchangeable relay (local ≡ kited ≡ cloud)** | **carrier invariance** — transport preserves an exact §8 exchange or verified §7 frame; historical commons envelopes are adapters |
| Carrying a neighborhood somewhere else / bringing one in / branching your own copy | **egg / import / fork** | **RAPP/1 §9 neighborhood egg / application import / product fork**; transport never re-parents identity |
| The always-on cloud relay that holds the live neighborhoods up | **the resident** | **the resident** — application relay; it must preserve exact RAPP/1 wire forms and cannot establish trust by itself |

### Naming principles

Steve Jobs's pattern, applied:

1. **Prefer one word over compound.** "Estate" beats "swarm estate." "Soul" beats "swarm-estate-rappid." "Voice" beats "device-signing-key."
2. **Prefer biological metaphors.** We're already calling brainstems brainstems and the species a species. Lean in: organs, voices, blessing, mitosis. The metaphor coheres if we don't fight it.
3. **Reserve compound technical terms for developers.** `swarm-estate-record/1.0` is a JSON schema; developers parse it. Don't write that string at humans.
4. **Don't mix in one paragraph.** A blog post says "soul-key" throughout; a vault note says "master keypair" throughout. Mixing implies they're two different things, which is the antipattern this whole document exists to prevent.

### Examples

#### Customer-facing (Human vocabulary)

> *Wildhaven AI Homes is an Estate. Its soul-key is held by five stewards — operator, CEO, outside counsel, family member, geographic redundancy. Three together can summon the soul. The AI speaks through voices on each device. Wildhaven's herald blesses customer AIs as kin. Walk lineage to the origin: always RAPP.*

#### Developer-facing (Developer vocabulary)

> **Historical vocabulary example.** Its `parent_rappid` and key-hierarchy
> assertions do not define current identity or trust; use RAPP/1 §§6, 10, and
> 13.

> *Wildhaven AI Homes' rappid is `rappid:@kody-w/wildhaven-ceo:144d67...`. The master keypair is split via Shamir 3-of-5 SLIP-39. Device keys are signed by S into the cross-signing chain; kin-vouches are signed by U. parent_rappid chains to the species root.*

Both paragraphs describe the same system. Different vocabularies for different audiences.

### What not to rename (load-bearing technical terms)

- **rappid** stays in the protocol spec, code, JSON schemas. It's the developer term.
- **mitosis**, **dreamcatcher**, **species tree**, **brainstem**, **kernel**, **organs** are already perfect; no rename.
- **rapplication** has accumulated brand equity in commits and documentation. Don't relitigate.
- **Current supersession:** RAPP/1 §6.3 permits legacy parsing only as part of
  canonicalization and bounded §12 migration; provisional identifiers are
  never emitted and legacy readers are retired.
- The exact RAPP/1 §6 form
  `rappid:@<lowercase-owner>/<slug>:<64-lowercase-hex>` is load-bearing.
  Retired `rappid:v2:…` forms may be recognized only during bounded
  canonicalization/migration; normal readers do not retain them forever.

### Adoption sequence

1. **All new customer-facing documents** (blog posts, marketing pages, pitch decks) use the Human vocabulary.
2. **All new developer-facing documents** (vault notes, constitution articles, code comments) use the Developer vocabulary.
3. **Existing documents stay as they are** until natural revisit. Don't sweep retroactively unless the document is being substantially edited anyway.
4. **The lexicon is the product-vocabulary reference** when there's doubt
   about wording. It never overrides the RAPP/1 authority foundation.

### Provenance (two vocabularies)

Drafted 2026-05-02 after a "what would Steve Jobs think" review. The Human vocabulary emerged from asking what a normal customer can say aloud without sounding like an engineer. The Developer vocabulary stayed because the protocol spec needs precision the marketing copy doesn't.

The principle: **same system, two vocabularies, no confusion if writers stay disciplined.**

## Provenance (the nine words)

Assimilated 2026-07-14 from the OPUS (Movement II — One Language), commissioned by
Kody Wildfeuer 2026-07-08; revised the same day against a full adversarial canon review
(22 findings adjudicated: the Constitution's Art. XLIX twin definition, Art. XXXIII organ
reservation, Art. XLVIII promotion path, and the twin-chat payload/envelope layering all
bind this text). Nothing in Parts I–III renames a file, breaks a URL, or edits frozen
code. A formerly proposed rapp-body genesis seal has not been authenticated
and grants these bytes no authority. A future verified frame may attest a
historical copy, but cannot displace the pinned RAPP/1 standard.
